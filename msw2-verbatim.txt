Subfamily Sicistinae Allen, 1901 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 14:185 . SYNONYMS: Sminthi, Sminthinae. COMMENTS: Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) , Shenbrot (1992) , and others use the family name Sminthidae for this group, because Brandt's (1855) supergeneric taxon Sminthi predates Sicistinae Allen, 1901 «. However, article 66 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (1985:125-127) states that when two genera are united their respective type species remain the same, and the valid name of the newly formed taxon is that of the component taxon with the oldest valid name. Sicista Gray, 1827 predates Sminthus Nordmann, 1840 , and thus the correct genus name is Sicista . Sicistinae is the valid subfamily (or family) name according to article 23 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (1985:47). The separation of Sicistinae from Zapodinae , suggested by Ellerman (1940) , is supported by the results of Shenbrot (1986 , 1992 ), Sokolov et al. (1987b), Stein (1990) , and Vorontsov (1969). Though the modern distribution of Sicista is Palaearctic, Sicistinae has been recorded from Pleistocene deposits in North America ( Martin, 1989a ).

Subfamily Zapodinae Coues, 1875 . Bull. U.S. Geol. Geog. Surv. Terr., ser. 2,5(3):253 . COMMENTS: The recognition of three distinct genera of zapodines has been challenged ( Corbet, 1978c ). Higher level relationships among zapodines have been addressed by Preble (1899) , who described Eozapus and Napaeozapus as new subgenera of Zapus , and by Krutzsch (1954) , who supported generic separation based on differences in tooth number and occlusal pattern, bacula, and ear ossicles. Klingener (1964:75) found no consistant differences in the myology of Zapus versus Napaeozapus ( Eozapus was not included in his study), but favored generic separation of the two based on dental morphology. The dental differences documented in Preble (1899) and Krutzsch (1954) are substantial and phylogenetically significant; following Ellerman (1940) and Krutzsch (1954) , three genera are retained here. A critical study documenting other morphological characters, and /or molecular differentiation among zapodines, as well as the level of differentiation of zapodines relative to other dipodids, is needed.

Their results indicated that generic separation of michaelis was not supported, particularly if kozlovi was retained in Salpingotus . In addition, no phylogenetic study has been done. Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987:162) suggested that Salpingotus included Salpingotulus , a hypothesis followed here.

COMMENTS: The monophyly of dipodids seems well established ( Ellerman, 1940 ; Klingener, 1984; Shenbrot, 1992 ; Stein, 1990 ; Vinogradov, 1930 ). Authors have frequently recognized either a single family, Dipodidae , or two families, Zapodidae (including sicistines and zapodines), and Dipodidae ; recently Shenbrot (1992) recognized four families including Allactagidae , Dipodidae , Sminthidae ( Sicistidae ), and Zapodidae . In a phylogenetic study based on limb myology, Stein (1990) proposed to recognize Sicistidae and Dipodidae (including zapodines and all other dipodids). Sicistines are often regarded as representing the most primitive dipodids morphologically; however, Sokolov et al. (1987b) and Vorontsov (1969) hypothesized that zapodines possess the most primitive karyotype of dipodids, from which those of sicistines and other dipodids are derived. Shenbrot (1992) incorporated internal and external phallic morphology, coronal structure of the molars, and bullar morphology in a phylogenetic analysis. His final classification is eclectic, based on the results of cladistic analysis and degree of morphological divergence (phenetic distance). His arrangement differed significantly from that of Stein (1990) in that Sicista was not shown to be the most primitive dipodoid (all four families are sister taxa), and Euchoreutinae was hypothesized to be most closely related to Sicistinae , and was united with Sicistinae in Sminthidae ( Sicistidae ); Stein (1990) proposed Euchoreutinae to be a sister group of zapodines and allactagines, and placed all groups except Sicista in Dipodidae . The true sister group of dipodids has not been established, and comparison with other outgroups such as sciurids, myoxids, heteromyids, and muroids that retain more primitive characters than Phodopus (used in the phylogenetic study by Stein, 1990 ) and other Cricetinae (as defined by Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; implied as an outgroup by Shenbrot, 1992 ), is needed for confirmation of assigned character polarities. Reviews of the relationship of dipodids to other rodents were given by Klingener (1964 , 1984). An integrative phylogenetic analysis including appropriate outgroups, and incorporating the characters listed above, and/or molecular data sets, should be undertaken to help elucidate dipodid relationships. Vinogradov (1930 , 1937 ) proposed a classification, modified slightly by Ellerman (1940) , that provided the foundation for systematic research of dipodids. Phylogenetic studies have supported much of this original classification, though the proposed relationships among the higher taxa have changed significantly. Pending further study, a single family is recognized here, but hypotheses supported by Stein (1990) and Shenbrot (1992) are incorporated at the subfamilial level. Reviews of dipodid research and classification were contributed by Gambaryan et al. (1980) , Heptner (1984) , Klingener (1984), Shenbrot (1986 , 1992 ), and Stein (1990) .

(1980) , Dutrillaux (1986) , Filippucci et al. (1988 a, b, 1990 ), and Tranier and Petter (1978) . Allozyme data given by Filippucci et al. (1988c) indicated that N African and Middle Eastern populations form a monophyletic group, and supported the recognition of melanurus as a distinct species of Eliomys . This hypothesis is tentatively followed here, but is based on few samples and needs corroboration. A critical morphological study of Eliomys throughout its range is needed.
Myomimus Ognev, 1924 . Priroda Okhota Ukraine [Nat. and Hunting in Ukraine ], Kharkov , 1- 2:115-116 . TYPE SPECIES: Myomimus personatus Ognev, 1924 . SYNONYMS: Philistomys (see Kowalski, 1963 ). COMMENTS: Tribe Myomimini . This genus is in need of systematic revision. Distribution shown in Vorontsov (1986). The closest living relative of Myomimus may be Selevinia (Wahlert et al., In Press). See also comments under Leithiinae and Selevinia .
Selevinia Belosludov and Bazhanov, 1939 . Uchen. Zap. Kaz. Univ. Alma-Ata, 1 (1):81 . TYPE SPECIES: Selevinia betpakdalaensis Belosludov and Bazhanov, 1939 . COMMENTS: Tribe Myomimini . Belosludov and Bazhanov (1939) recognized Selevinia as a new genus of murids, and then as a separate family of rodents seemingly allied to myoxids ( Bazhanov and Belosludov, 1941 ). Based on a suite of morphological characters, Ognev (1947) hypothesized that Selevinia was a highly differentiated dormouse most closely related to Myomimus . Beacuse of its distinct dental formula and structure, Ognev (1947) listed Selevinia in a separate subfamily, a hypothesis independantly suggested by Ellerman (1949a) . Published descriptions and figures of Selevinia included derived character states that allowed Wahlert et al. (In Press) to place this genus within Myomimini, supporting Ognev's (1947) hypothesis. Though the nearest extant relative of Selevinia is proposed to be Myomimus, Plioselevinia, a fossil genus known from Lower Pliocene breccia of Poland , may be the closest relative of this genus.

Daams (1981) included these genera in the Dryomyinae (= Leithiinae), as did van der Meulen and de Bruijn (1982) . However, the phylogenetic study by Wahlert et al. (In Press) supported the inclusion of Glirulus within the Myoxinae (see also comment under Myoxinae ). Glirulus appears to be the sister group of Myoxus and Muscardinus (Wahlert et al., In Press).

COMMENTS: Kratochvil (1973) proposed to place Muscardinus in its own subfamily, Muscardininae, based on the uniquely derived stomach anatomy, molar morphology, and phallic features. De Bruijn (1967) and Daams (1981) both included Muscardinus in the Myoxinae based on dental morphology. This arrangement was supported by the results of Wahlert et al. (In Press). Muscardinus appears to be most closely related to Myoxus (Wahlert et al., In Press). See also comment under Myoxinae .

Family Myoxidae Gray, 1821 . London Med. Repos., 15:303 . SYNONYMS: Gliridae Thomas, 1897 (excluding Platacanthomyinae); Leithiidae Lydekker, 1895 ; Muscardinidae Palmer, 1899 (excluding Platacanthomyinae). COMMENTS: Simpson (1945) deemed Myoxidae Gray, 1821 invalid due to the apparent synonymy of the type genus Myoxus Zimmermann, 1780 , with Glis Brisson, 1762 , and used Gliridae Thomas, 1897 . Hopwood (1947) argued that Brisson's names are invalid because they are not Linnaean or binomial. As noted by Hopwood (1947) , Glis is valid in Erxleben (1777) for marmots, ground-squirrels, voles, and lemmings, rendering Glis Storr, 1780 (which included pedetids, dormice, and other rodents) invalid. Thus the oldest available name to replace Glis Brisson is Myoxus Zimmermann , valid in Linnaeus (1788) for dormice, and the correct family name for dormice is Myoxidae (for further discussion see Wahlert et al., In Press). Carleton and Musser (1984) verified and discussed Alston's (1876) placement of Platacanthomyinae within the Muridae . Wahlert et al. (In Press) provided a history of classification and an introduction to morphological characters of myoxids. With the exception of the Graphiurinae , the extant genera are surviving members of distinct evolutionary lineages which were clearly differentiated by the early to medial Miocene ( de Bruijn, 1967 ; Daams, 1981 ). De Bruijn (1967) and Daams (1981) each proposed classifications of fossil and extant myoxids based on dental characters. Wahlert et al. (In Press) incorporated dental characters plus forty-three osteological characters in a phylogenetic analysis of extant myoxid genera. Their resulting classification is similar to that of de Bruijn (1967) except that Glirulus is included in Myoxinae (not placed in its own subfamily), Leithiinae is subdivided into two tribes, and Selevinia is placed as a close relative of Myomimus . The classification of Wahlert et al. (In Press) is followed below. The distributions of the species occuring in China were verified and much enhanced by the efforts of Lin Yonglie.
Subfamily Graphiurinae Winge, 1887 . E Museu Lundii, 1:109,123 . COMMENTS: Daams (1981) suggested that the Graphiurinae are most closely related to the Leithiinae, based on tooth morphology. The results of Wahlert et al. (In Press) indicated that the Graphiurinae represent the earliest or most primitive branch of myoxids.
Graphiurus Smuts, 1832 . Enumer. Mamm. Capensium, pp. 32 -33. TYPE SPECIES: Sciurus ocularis Smith, 1829 . SYNONYMS: Aethoglis, Claviglis, Gliriscus (see Ellerman, 1940 ; Ellerman et al., 1953). COMMENTS: The revision of Graphiurus by Genest-Villard (1978) , based mostly on size grades, underestimated species diversity, particularly in the murinus group. Species limits were defined in parts of Africa (e.g., Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ; Robbins and Schütter, 1981). A systematic revision of Graphiurus is in progress and the species recognized below reflect information in the literature as well as examination of museum specimens; results are provisional and assignment of synonyms incomplete.

DISTRIBUTION: Sudan ( Setzer, 1956 ), Uganda ( Delany, 1975 ), Ethiopia ( Corbet and Yalden, 1972 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ), Kenya ( Hollister, 1919 ), Tanzania ( Swynnerton and Hayman, 1951 ), Malawi ( Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ; Ansell, 1989b ), Mozambique ( Smithers and Tello, 1976 ), E Zaire ( Rahm and Christiaensen, 1963 ), S Angola , Zambia , Zimbabwe ( Smithers and Wilson, 1979 ), Botswana ( Smithers, 1971 ), E and N Namibia , southern Africa ( de Graaff, 1981 ; Roberts, 1951 ; Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: alticola, butteri, cineraceus, cinerascens, dasilvai, erythrobronchus, etoschae, griselda, isolatus, lalandianus, littoralis, marrensis, pretoriae, raptor, saturatus , schneideri, selindensis, soleatus, streeteri, sudanensis, tzaneenensis, vandami, vulcanicus, woosnami, zuluensis (see Allen, 1939 , and Setzer, 1956 , for citations). COMMENTS: The synonyms (and therefore the distribution) listed here for G. murinus almost certainly contain names which are actually synonyms of G. microtis and other species, but pending systematic revision they cannot be confidently separated here, and are kept in their traditional listing under murinus . Meester et al. (1986) broke murinus into three subspecies: murinus , microtis and griselda. Though microtis is considered a valid species here and in Ansell (1989a , b) and Ansell and Dowsett (1988) , the allocation of synonyms listed under this name in Meester et al. (1986) has yet to be documented. Three different karyotypes were found in the G. murinus group in southern Africa ( Dippenaar et al., 1983 ), providing another indication of the complexity of the relationships of named forms traditionally placed in this species.
Graphiurus lorraineus Dollman, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 5:285 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Welle (Uele) River, Molegbwe, south of Setema Rapids .

Graphiurus hueti Rochebrune, 1883 . Act. Soc. Linn. Bordeaux, 37, 4(7):110 . TYPE LOCALITY: Senegal , near Saint-Louis . DISTRIBUTION: Senegal , south to Sierra Leone , Liberia ( Kuhn, 1965 ), Ivory Coast ( Aellen, 1965 , and in Mt. Nimba Reserve see Heim de Balsac and Lamotte, 1958 ), Ghana , Nigeria ( Happold, 1987 ), Cameroon (Robbins and Schütter, 1981; Schütter et al., 1985), Centrai African Republic, and Gabon .

DISTRIBUTION: E Angola ( Hayman, 1963b ), NW Zambia ( Ansell, 1978 ), and S Zaire ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: schoutedeni (see Ansell, 1989a ,). COMMENTS: Allen (1939) listed monardi as a subspecies of G. hueti , an arrangement followed by Genest-Villard (1978) . Ellerman et al. (1953) were correct in stating that monardi has no close affinity with G. hueti .
Graphiurus microtis (Noack, 1887) . Zool. Jahrb., 2:248 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Marungu, Mpala . DISTRIBUTION: Zambia , Malawi , and Tanzania ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Following Ansell (1989a , b) and Ansell and Dowsett (1988) , microtis is recognized as a species distinct from G. murinus . See comment under G. murinus regarding synonyms for this species.

SYNONYMS: angolensis , eastwoodae, jordani, parvulus (see Ellerman et al., 1953). COMMENTS: Discussion of G. platyops vs. G. platyops parvulus given by Ansell (1978) .
Graphiurus olga (Thomas, 1925) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. ser. 9, 16:191 . TYPE LOCALITY: Niger, Air, Tehsiderak (Tassederek), 2350 ft. (see Schütter et al., 1985) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from three localities in N Niger, N Nigeria and NE Cameroon ; see Schütter et al. (1985). COMMENTS: See comments under G. parvus .
Graphiurus rupicola (Thomas and Hinton, 1925) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1925:232 . TYPE LOCALITY: Namibia , Karibib, 3842 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Namibia (see Thomas and Hinton, 1925 ) and NW South Africa (see Shortridge and Carter, 1938 ), in a narrow strip from Karibib and Mt. Brukaros, Namibia , south to Port Nolloth and Eenriet, NW Cape Prov. , South Africa . SYNONYMS: australis, kaokoensis, montosüs (see Roberts, 1951 ). COMMENTS: Ellerman et al. (1953) and Genest-Villard (1978) listed rupicola as a subspecies of G. platyops , but Roberts (1951) recognized it as a distinct species, a position followed here based on study of specimens.
Graphiurus parvus (True, 1893) . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 16(95A):601 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Tana River , between the coast and Hameye . DISTRIBUTION: Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast , Ghana , Nigeria , Mali , Sudan , N Uganda and Kenya (see Hollister, 1919 ), Ethiopia , Somalia , Tanzania (see Swynnerton and Hayman, 1951 ). In W Africa see Rosevear (1969) . SYNONYMS: brockmani, dollmani, foxi , internus, personatus (see Allen, 1939 , for citations). COMMENTS: Schütter et al. (1985) discussed taxonomic problems associated with the small dormice occurring in savannahs, scrub, and woodlands of west, east, and southern Africa. Three species of this grade are provisionally recognized here; G. kelleni , G. olga , and G. parvus .
Graphiurus surdus Dollman, 1912 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 9:314 . TYPE LOCALITY: Equatorial Guinea , Rio Muni Prov., Benito River . DISTRIBUTION: Rio Muni Prov. ( Equatorial Guinea ) and S Cameroon . SYNONYMS: schwabi (see Allen, 1939 , for citation). COMMENTS: Allen (1939) and Robbins and Schütter (1981) listed schwabi as a synonym of haedulus (= G. lorraineus ), but the type specimen of schwabi , a juvenile, represents G. surdus .
Subfamily Leithiinae Lydekker, 1896 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1895:862 [1896]. SYNONYMS: Dryomyinae, Myomiminae, Seleviniinae. COMMENTS: Lydekker (1895) proposed the family Leithiidae to separate the giant Pleistocene dormouse of Malta from other myoxids, and Leithia for the type genus. Major (1899) argued that Leithia was in fact a myoxid, and Leithiidae a junior synonym of Myoxidae . De Bruijn (1967) proposed Dryomyinae, which included Leithia, Dryomys , Eliomys , and other genera. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (1985) mandates that when a nominal taxon is lowered in rank in the family group, its type genus remains the same. Because Dryomyinae de Bruijn contains Leithia , the correct name for the subfamily is Leithiinae . The results of the phylogenetic analysis by Wahlert et al. (In Press) indicated that the genera listed below form a monophyletic group composed of two tribes: Leithiini (Dryomys and Eliomys ) and Myomimini ( Myomimus and Selevinia ). All genera in Leithiinae share derived dental and osteological characters; see comments in each genus.
Dryomys sichuanensis (Wang, 1985) . Acta Theriol. Sinica, 5(1):67 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , N Sichuan Prov. , Pinwu county, Wang-lang Natural Reserve . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality, a subalpine deciduous and coniferous forest in the Sichuan highlands; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Wang (1985a) described sichuanensis as a species of Chaetocauda , a genus he placed in the Myomiminae. Based on Wang's comparative chart and photograph, the shape and details of the skull and teeth greatly resemble those of Dryomys , not Myomimus ; hence its placement here. Careful systematic study is required to determine whether or not sichuanensis is a distinct species of Dryomys .
Dryomys Thomas, 1906 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1905(2):348 [1906]. TYPE SPECIES: Mus nitedula Pallas, 1778 . SYNONYMS: Chaetocauda (see comment under D. sichuanensis ), Dyromys (see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:544 , and footnote in Simpson, 1945:92 ), Elius (excluding glis ). COMMENTS: Tribe Leithiini . Dryomys seems most closely related to Eliomys (Wahlert et al., In Press). See also comments under Leithiinae.

Philander Tiedemann, 1808 . Allgemeine Zool., Mensch Säugthiere, Landshut, 1:426 . TYPE SPECIES: Philander virginianus Tiedemann, 1808 , by subsequent designation ( Hershkovitz, 1949a ). SYNONYMS: Hylothylax Cabrera, 1919 ; Metachirops Matschie, 1916 ; Philander Gray, 1843 (based on Philander Brisson, 1762 ); Sarigua Muirhead, 1919 (part). COMMENTS: Pine (1973) used Metachirops for this genus, as did Hall (1981) , Husson (1978) , and Corbet and Hill (1980 ; but not 1991 when they used Philander ). Philander Tiedemann is used here as the correct generic name because, as Hershkovitz (1949«; 1981) pointed out, Philander virginianus Tiedemann was a replacement name for Didelphis opossum Linnaeus. Hershkovitz (1976) designated the female illustrated by Seba (1734) as lectotype of D. opossum and, thereby, also making Seba's specimen the lectotype of Philander virginianus. Therefore, Husson's (1978) attempt to synonymize Philander Tiedemann under Didelphis Linnaeus by synonymizing P. virginianus Tiedemann with Didelphis virginiana Kerr was too late and is invalid. If Husson's (1978) action had preceded Hershkovitz's (1976) , Metachirops would be the correct name for this genus.

COMMENTS: Subgenus Sorex . Youngman (1975) provided evidence that tundrensis is specifically distinct from arcticus . Palearctic populations formerly referred to arcticus were included in tundrensis by Junge et al. (1983) . Hoffmann (1987) and van Zyll de Jong (1991b) discussed additional aspects of its taxonomy and distribution. Kozlovskii (1976) found irkutensis and sibiriensis to be karyotypically distinct; possibly two sibling species occur throughout the Palearctic range. Meylan and Hausser (1991) described a karyotype from Canada that is "identical" to some in Siberia.

Sorex thibetanus Kastschenko, 1905 . Izv. Tomsk . Univ., 27:93 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Tsaidam" [NE Tibet ] . DISTRIBUTION: Himalyas and NE Tibet . COMMENTS: The pygmy shrews of the Himalayas are the subject of controversy. The original description of thibetanus (as a subspecies of minutus ) is not very helpful and the holotype in the Tomsk Academy was considered to be lost (Yudin, pers. comm. 1977 to the author); Hutterer (1979) therefore regarded thibetanus as a nomen dubium. Dolgov and Hoffmann (1977) and later Hoffmann (1987) used thibetanus to define a Himalayan species in which they included buchariensis , kozlovi , planiceps , and specimens from Nepal and China reported as minutus by various authors. Hutterer (1979) instead recognized three species, buchariensis , planiceps , and minutus as occurring in the Himalayas and regarded kozlovi and thibetanus as indeterminable. Zaitsev (1988) pointed out differences between buchariensis and thibetanus . Surprisingly, the holotype of thibetanus turned up in the Zoological Museum of Moscow ( Baranova et al., 1981 ) and Hoffmann (1987) reported on its measurements. These did not solve the problem but instead matched well with minutus . The controversy still remains unresolved and can be solved presumably only with new material and a more complete data set. Provisionally all the mentioned forms are listed separately.
Soriculus Blyth, 1854 . J. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, 23:733 . TYPE SPECIES: Corsira nigrescens Gray, 1842 . SYNONYMS: Chodsigoa, Episoriculus . COMMENTS: Subfamily Soricinae , tribe Neomyini ; see Repenning (1967:45) . Reumer (1984:14) claimed that Soriculini Kretzoi, 1965, has priority over Neomyini Repenning , 1965, however, Neomyini Matschie, 1909, has priority over both. Includes Chodsigoa and Episoriculus as subgenera; see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c:24) ; but also see Repenning (1967:52) and Jameson and Jones (1977:474-475) , who considered Episoriculus a distinct genus.

Kisha (see Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ) . DISTRIBUTION: S Ukraine and Caucasus; possibly Turkey and N Iran . COMMENTS: Subgenus Sorex . Formerly included in minutus but specimens from Caucasus have a slighly different karyotype (2n=40, NF=60) which led Kozlovskii (1973) and Sokolov and Tembotov (1989) to regard volnuchini as a full species. The karyotype of S. buchariensis is very similar ( Ivanitskaya et al., 1977 ). Morphologically, volnuchini is not distinguishable from minutus ; also, the karyotype of topotypical specimens needs to be studied to clarify the status of volnuchini .

Anourosorex Milne-Edwards, 1872 . Rech. Hist. Nat. Mamm., p. 264 . TYPE SPECIES: Anourosorex squamipes Milne-Edwards, 1872 . SYNONYMS: Pygmura . COMMENTS: Tribe Neomyini ( Repenning, 1967:61 ) or Anourosoricini. Reumer (1984: 17) placed the genus in the tribe Amblycoptini Kormos, 1926 , but this is antedated by Anourosoricini Anderson, 1879 . Specific taxonomy is in need of revision. For the fossil history, see Zheng (1985) and Storch and Qiu (1991) .
Subfamily Soricinae Fischer von Waldheim, 1817 . Mem. Soc. Imp. Nat. Moscow , 5:372 . COMMENTS: The recognition of two subfamilies within the Soricidae is mainly based on Repenning (1967) , and has been widely accepted; see George (1986), but see also comments under family. Reumer (1984) modified the tribal subdivision. Work in progress, however, raises doubt on the validity of current concepts.

Chimarrogale Anderson, 1877 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 46:262 . TYPE SPECIES: Crossopus himalayicus Gray, 1842 . SYNONYMS: Chimmarogale, Crossogale . COMMENTS: Tribe Neomyini ; see Repenning (1967:61) . Because of the presence of white teeth the genus was occasionally included in subfamily Crocidurinae , but since Repenning (1967) , overwhelming evidence has been accumulated showing that Chimarrogale is a soricine shrew ( Vogel and Besancon, 1979 ; Mori et al., 1991 ). Gureev (1971:226) included Chimarrogale in his subtribe Nectogalina within the Blarinini, while Reumer (1984:14) included it in the tribe Soriculini; see comments under genus Neomys . Includes Crossogale; see Harrison (1958) , who also revised the genus. His arrangement was found to be more realistic than the present practice of lumping all forms together in one or two species.

COMMENTS: Medway (1977) considered phaeura as a subspecies of himalayica but Corbet (1978c) and Jones and Mumford (1971) maintained styani and phaeura as separate species. Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1966:87) included sumatrana in this species, but Gureev (1979:458) listed it as a distinct species, a view followed here.
Chimarrogale himalayica (Gray, 1842) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 10:261 . TYPE LOCALITY: " India ", Punjab, Chamba . DISTRIBUTION: Kashmir through SE Asia to Indochina; C and S China ; Taiwan . SYNONYMS: leander, varennei. COMMENTS: Corbet (1978c) included leander, platycephala , varennei, and probably hantu in himalayica . Gureev (1979) listed leander, hantu , platycephala , and varennei as distinct species without comment; both views are only partially accepted here.

DISTRIBUTION: Cordillera de Merida , and mountains near Caracas, Venezuela , see Tello (1979) . COMMENTS: This species was commonly included in thomasi ( Handley, 1976 ; Eisenberg, 1989 ) but is much larger and has a more robust dentition. Choate (pers. comm., 1983) and Hutterer (1986d) therefore considered meridensis a valid species.

Many of the listed synonyms have never been properly studied and identified; recently, Lehmann (1983) referred constrictus to Crocidura russula . The form niethammeri from NE Spain may represent a valid species (López-Fuster et al., 1990).

Sorex araneus Linnaeus, 1758 . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:53 . TYPE LOCALITY: "in Europe cryptis"; restricted to Uppsala , Sweden by Thomas (1911a:143) . DISTRIBUTION: C, E, and N Europe including the British Isis (with some isolated populations in France , Italy and Spain ), east to Siberia. SYNONYMS: alticola, antinorii, bergensis, bohemicus, bolkayi, carpathicus, castaneus, concinnus, crassicaudatus, csikii, daubentonii , eleonorae, grantii, hermanni , huelleri, ignotus, iochanseni, labiosus, macrotrichus, marchicus, melanodon, mollis, monsvairani, nigra, nuda, ryphaeus, pallidus, personatus, petrovi, peucinius, preussi , pulcher, pyrenaicus , pyrrhonota , quadricaudatus, rhinolophus, silanus, surinamensis , tetragonurus, uralensis, vulgaris, wettsteini. COMMENTS: Type species of subgenus Sorex . S. araneus is the preferred Palearctic species for studies in ecology and evolution; see Hausser et al. (1990) and Hausser (1991) for reviews. The species is well known for its Robertsonian chromosome polymorphism ( Meylan, 1964 ) and for the tendency to establish local karyotype races ( Hausser et al., 1985 ; Searle, 1984 ; Zima and Kräl, 1984 h); in Switzerland , two karyotype races occur which behave like parapatric species ( Hausser et al., 1986 ). Includes Blarina pyrrhonota Jentink, 1910 , a name assigned to Cryptotis surinamensis by Cabrera (1958) ; however, Husson (1963) showed that the locality information was incorrect and that it was based on a Sorex araneus . The holotype skin (skull lost) of Sylvisorex preussi Matschie , formerly thought to represent an endemic Myosorex of Mt. Cameroon ( Heim de Balsac, 1968b ), is a Sorex araneus and is therefore included as a synonym. Sorex isodon marchicus , recently described from E Germany ( Passarge, 1984 ), is also tentatively included in araneus as no clear characters are known to distinguish it from the latter.
Sorex Linnaeus, 1758 . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:53 . TYPE SPECIES: Sorex araneus Linnaeus, 1758 . SYNONYMS: Amphisorex, Atophyrax , Corsira, Eurosorex , Homalurus, Microsorex, Musaraneus, Neosorex, Ognevia , Otisorex, Oxyrhin, Soricidus, Stroganovia . COMMENTS: Type genus of Soricidae . The systematic relationships of a large number of Holarctic species were studied by George (1988) ; her proposals for subgeneric allocation are mainly followed here. Keys and/or reviews are available for the species of various geographical areas: Canada ( van Zyll de Jong, 1983a ); North and Middle America ( Junge and Hoffmann, 1981 ; Carraway, 1990 ); China ( Hoffmann, 1987 ); Siberia ( Yudin, 1989 ); and Europe ( Niethammer and Krapp, 1990 ). Microsorex was formerly regarded as a full genus, then reduced to a subgenus of Sorex by Diersing (1980b) , and is now regarded as a synonym of subgenus Otisorex (see George, 1988 ). The subgenus Amphisorex (type species Sorex hermanni Duvernoy, 1834 ) was alternatively listed under Sorex and Neomys by Miller (1912a) , Ellermann and Morrison-Scott (1951), and Corbet (1978c) . Miller (1912a) stated that the type of Sorex hermanni consisted of a skin of Sorex araneus and a skull of Neomys fodiens. To avoid further confusion, I herewith designate the skin of Sorex hermanni Duvernoy, 1834 as the lectotype , thus making hermanni a synonym of araneus, and Amphisorex a synonym of Sorex. Besides subgenera a number of species groups have been distinguished such as the araneus-arcticus group ( Meylan and Hausser, 1973 ; Hausser et al., 1985 ), the cinereus group (van Zyll de Jong, 19916), and the vagrans group ( Carraway, 1990 ), the boundaries and contents of which are still highly controversial. Old World species of Sorex were reviewed by Dannelid (19916) who provided a phylogenetic hypothesis of relationships.

DISTRIBUTION: Yunnan and Sichuan ( China ), and possibly Nepal . COMMENTS: Subgenus Sorex . Considered as a possible subspecies of asper ( Corbet, 1978c ) but retained as a full species related to tundrensis by Hoffmann (1987) who also suggested that a specimen from Nepal recorded by Agrawal and Chakraborty (1971) may represent excelsus .

Sorex hydrodromus Dobson, 1889 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 4:373 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Alaska , "Unalaska Islands, Aleutian Islands" (probably in error, presumably from St. Paul, Pribilof Isis) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from St. Paul in the Pribilof Isis, Bering Sea. SYNONYMS: pribilofensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Otisorex . There is some discrepancy in the literature on the correct name for this species. Dobson's hydrodromus has priority, but because of an apparently incorrect type locality information and further inconsistencies in the original description, Hoffmann and Peterson (1967) proposed to suppress hydrodromus in favour of pribilofensis Merriam, 1895, a suggestion followed by van Zyll de Jong (1991 b) . However, Yudin (1969) , Baranova et al. (1981) , Hall (1981) , Junge and Hoffmann (1981) , and Honacki et al. (1982) retained hydrodromus , while Gureev (1979) listed both hydrodromus and pribilofensis as species. As the holotype of hydrodromus still exists in the St. Petersburg Museum, there seems to be no reason for not following the rule of priority.

DISTRIBUTION: SE Siberia from S shore of the Sea of Okhotsk to N Korea and probably Manchuria; Sakhalin Isl; Hokkaido ( Japan ). SYNONYMS: hyojironis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Sorex . This species has long been included in minutus but its specific status is now widely accepted on the basis of penial (Dolgov and Lukanova, 1966) and cranial (Hutterer, 1979) morphology, karyotype ( Orlov and Bulatova, 1983 ), and allozyme data ( George, 1988 ).

Known from a single specimen, until near-topotype (National Museum of Natural History - 449080) obtained in 1987. Regarded as a subspecies of thibetanus by some authors ( Dolgov and Hoffmann, 1977 ; Hoffmann, 1987 ) or included in buchariensis by others ( Corbet, 1978c ; Gureev, 1979 ). Hutterer (1979) recognized inconsistencies in the various published figures and descriptions of the same holotype specimen and regarded kozlovi as a doubtful taxon; see also under buchariensis and thibetanus .

DISTRIBUTION: SE Norway and Finland through Siberia to the Pacific coast; Kamchatka; Sakhalin Isl; Kurile Isis; probably also NE China and Korea . SYNONYMS: gravesi, princeps, ruthenus. COMMENTS: Subgenus Sorex . Probably not conspecific with sinalis as suggested by Corbet (1978c) and Dolgov (1985) ; see Siivonen (1965) and Hoffmann (1987) . Because the well established name isodon is antedated by gravesi, Hoffmann (1987) suggested that isodon be declared the valid name; the case needs to be submitted to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. The species was reviewed by Sulkava (1990) . The recently described isodon marchicus ( Passarge, 1984 ) is provisionally included in araneus ; see comments under that species.

SYNONYMS: bachmani, eionis, fisheri, wagneri. COMMENTS: Subgenus Otisorex . As pointed out by Junge and Hoffmann (1981) , this species is inappropriately named because it has one of the shortest rostra of North American Sorex . Junge and Hoffmann (1981) also suggested that shrews of the Great Dismal Swamp described as fisheri and traditionally included in longirostris as a subspecies are much larger and may represent a valid species.

For taxa currently included in /uliginosa see above and Jenkins (1976 , 1982). Medway (1977) and Heaney and Timm (1983b) also included dracula, which Lekagul and McNeely (1977) considered a distinct species. The list of synonyms is very provisional; see also under malayana .

COMMENTS: A member of the poensis group,/oxi may be conspecific with theresae , which it antedates; see Hutterer and Happold (1983) . A series from Owerri, S Nigeria , referred to /oxi by these authors, was later, upon re-examination, identified as a dark form of lamottei . The holotype of tephra Setzer, 1956 has been recently examined and is regarded as representing /oxi in S Sudan ; a previous allocation to viaria (Hutterer, 1984) was based upon examination of a paratype skin; however, the holotype represents a different species.

Crocidura gueldenstaedtii (Pallas, 1811) . Zoogr. Rosso-Asiat., 1:132 . TYPE LOCALITY: Georgia , near Dushet (N of Tbilisi ) . DISTRIBUTION: Transcaucasia. SYNONYMS: aralychensis, bogdanowii, fumigatus, longicaudata . COMMENTS: This name has produced much confusion. Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1966) listed it as a subspecies of russula and were followed by Corbet (1978c) , among others. Richter (1970) applied gueldenstaedtii even to Mediterranean populations of suaveolens and was followed in that action by Kahmann and Vesmanis (1976) . Hutterer (1981d) suggested that all these populations represent suaveolens ; this was supported by karyological and biochemical data ( Catzeflis et al., 1985 ). Despite convincing evidence some Russian authors (e.g., Grafodatsky et al., 1988) still claim the existence of gueldenstaedtii as a species in the Caucasus. This species is most certainly conspecific with suaveolens .

Crocidura maurisca Thomas, 1904 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 14:239 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Entebbe . DISTRIBUTION: Entebbe, Echuya Swamp ( Uganda ); Kaimosi ( Kenya ); in swamps and primary forest.
Crocidura mariquensis (A. Smith, 1844) . Illustr. Zool. S. Afr. Mamm., pl. 44, fig. 1 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , "A wooded ravine near the tropic of Capricorn" = Marico River, near its junction with Limpopo . DISTRIBUTION: Swamps and forest from South Africa to Mozambique , W Zimbabwe , and Zambia ; NW Botswana and NE Namibia to SC Angola ; perhaps SE Zaire . SYNONYMS: neavei, pilosa, shortridgei, sylvia. COMMENTS: Includes pilosa and Sylvia as synonyms and shortridgei and neavei as subspecies; see Dippenaar (1977 , 1979 ), who reviewed the species and selected a lectotype . May also include nigricans , which Crawford-Cabral (1987) considered distinct.
Crocidura maquassiensis Roberts, 1946 . Ann. Transvaal Mus ., 20:312 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , W Transvaal, Maquassi, Klipkuil . DISTRIBUTION: Transvaal ( South Africa ); Nyamaziwa Falls, and Matopo Hills ( Zimbabwe ). STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. SYNONYMS: malani.

Crocidura malayana Robinson and Kloss, 1911 . J. Fed. Malay St. Mus ., 4:241 -247. TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Perak , Maxwell's Hill . DISTRIBUTION: Peninsular Malaysia and offshore islands; exact distribution unknown. SYNONYMS: aagaardi, aoris, gravida, klossi , negligens, maporensis, tionis, weberi. COMMENTS: This species was included in /uliginosa by Jenkins (1976 , 1982), but Ruedi et al. (1990) reported two different karyotypes from sympatric populations in Peninsular Malaysia . They provisionally used malayana for the sibling species. Jenkins (1976 , 1982), who revised this group, listed the synonyms given here under subspecies /uliginosa malayana . The proper allocation of all described names has still to be elaborated; other synonyms are listed under /uliginosa.
Crocidura macowi Dollman, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 16:378 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , "Mt. Nyiro, S. of Lake Rudolf [Lake Turkana ]" . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Regarded as a synonym of hildegardeae by Osgood (1936) , but retained as a species by Heim de Balsac and Meester (1977) , who noticed similarities to niobe .
Crocidura macmillani Dollman, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 16:361 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , "Kotelee, Walamo" . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Formerly included in fumosa ( Yalden et al., 1976 ) or luna ( Heim de Balsac and Meester, 1977 ; Hutterer, 1981b ), but Dippenaar (1980) has shown that in Ethiopia two endemic species, macmillani and thalia , were covered under these names.
Crocidura nana Dobson, 1890 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 5:225 . TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia , Dolio . DISTRIBUTION: Somalia , Ethiopia . COMMENTS: The name nana has been applied to various small shrews of Somalia , Ethiopia , and Egypt , leading to the proposal ( Setzer, 1957 ) that nana is conspecific with religiosa (which it does not antedate); a conclusion followed by Heim de Balsac and Mein (1971) and Osborn and Helmy (1980) . Personal examination of the holotype of nana revealed that it represents a juvenile (skull inside the skin) of a species larger that religiosa ; this conclusion was supported by better preserved topotypical specimens from Somalia in the British Museum (Natural History), which were also compared with the neotype of religiosa ( Corbet, 1978c:27 ) . The proposed conspecificy is therefore not accepted, and religiosa remains an endemic of the Nile valley in Egypt . The relation of nana with other small species has yet to be studied.
Crocidura mutesae Heller, 1910 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 56(15):3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Kampala . DISTRIBUTION: Uganda ; perhaps more widely distributed. STATUS: Taxonomic status unsolved. COMMENTS: A large species, alternatively assigned to hirta ( Allen, 1939 ) or suahelae ( Heim de Balsac and Meester, 1977 ).
Crocidura muricauda (Miller, 1900) . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:645 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Mount Coffee, Liberia " . DISTRIBUTION: West African high forest from Guinea to Ghana . COMMENTS: Usually included in dolichura as a subspecies but constantly differs in its hairy tail while dolichura never shows any pilosity of the tail.

DISTRIBUTION: Montane forest in C and E Africa; Mt. Ruwenzori ( Uganda ); Mt. Meru ( Tanzania ), Imatong Mtns ( Sudan ); presumably also in Kenya . COMMENTS: Formerly a subspecies of fumosa but see Demeter and Hutterer (1986) and Dippenaar and Meester (1989) , who revised the species.
Crocidura monticola Peters, 1870 . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , 1870:584 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Java , Mount Lawu, near Surakarta . DISTRIBUTION: Borneo, Java, Peninsular Malaysia . SYNONYMS: bartelsii. COMMENTS: Revised by Jenkins (1982).

COMMENTS: A very distinctive species, resembling C. elongata of Sulawesi , or C. dolichura of Africa. Known by a handful of specimens; see Phillips (1980) for further information.
Crocidura minuta Otten, 1917 . Med. Burgerl. Geneesk. Dienst. Ned. Ind., 6:103 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Java , East Java . DISTRIBUTION: Java . STATUS: Uncertain. COMMENTS: May be conspecific with monticola , or an earlier name for maxi ; see Jenkins (1982). However, minuta Otten, 1917 , is preoccupied by minuta Lyddeker, 1902 , and thus not available. This problem needs to be resolved.
Crocidura monax Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:310 . TYPE LOCALITY: Tanzania , Mt. Kilimanjaro , Rombo, 6,000 ft. ( 1,828 m ) . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forests in W Kenya and N Tanzania . STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: Part of the the littoralis group; see Dieterlen and Heim de Balsac (1979) .

SYNONYMS: ansorgei, cabrerai, kempi, lakiundae, luluae, nilotica, nyikae, provocax, soricoides (?), zaodon, zena (see Heim de Balsac and Meester, 1977 ). COMMENTS: Includes luluae Matschie, 1926 (Luluabourg, Zaire ) and zaodon Osgood, 1910 (Nairobi, Kenya ) which were listed as separate species by Heim de Balsac and Meester (1977) and Dippenaar and Meester (1989) ; see Hutterer et al. (1987b) . The holotypes of nigrofusca , luluae and zaodon have been studied. Gureev (1979) listed ansorgei, nilotica, and zena as distinct species without comment.
Crocidura nigripes Miller and Hollister, 1921 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 34:101 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , Temboan, SW from Tondano Lake . DISTRIBUTION: N and C Sulawesi , in tropical rain forest (Musser, 1987). SYNONYMS: lipara.

DISTRIBUTION: Rainforest in Nigeria , Cameroon , and Bioko; exact distribution unknown. COMMENTS: Formerly included in poensis ; but see Heim de Balsac (1957) , Meylan and Vogel (1982) , and Hutterer and Happold (1983) .
Crocidura nicobarica Miller, 1902 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 24:776 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Nicobar Isis, Great Nicobar Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Great Nicobar Isl. (Nicobar Isis, India ). COMMENTS: Not a species of Suncus , as suggested by Krumbiegel (1978:71) . Corbet and Hill (1991) included jenkinsi which is retained as distinct until more evidence is presented.
Crocidura negrina Rabor, 1952 . Chicago Acad. Sci. Nat. Hist. Mise., 96:6 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Negros Isl, Cuernos de Negros Mtn, Dayongan, 1,300 m .

Crocidura neglecta Jentink, 1888 . Notes Leyden Mus ., 10:165 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sumatra . DISTRIBUTION: Sumatra . COMMENTS: May be conspecific with, and in that case a prior name for maxi ; see Jenkins (1982).
Crocidura nanilla Thomas, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:99 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , "probably Entebbe" . DISTRIBUTION: Dry and moist savanna from West Africa ( Mauritania ) to Kenya and Uganda ; perhaps further south. SYNONYMS: rudolfi. COMMENTS: Includes rudolfi; see Heim de Balsac and Meester (1977) . Often confused with other small species such as fuscomurina and pasha . For a discussion of "small Crocidura " , see Heim de Balsac (1968d) .
Crocidura paradoxura Dobson, 1886 . Ann. Mus . Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 4:566 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sumatra , Mt. Singalang, 2,000 m . DISTRIBUTION: Sumatra . STATUS: Unknown. COMMENTS: A large species with a long tail, possibly related to /uliginosa; specific identity unresolved (Jenkins, 1982:277).

Nimba ( Guinea , Liberia ); Sierra Leone (specimen in the National Museum of Natural History). STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: A very distinct species; not conspecific with wimmeri as previously suggested (see Hutterer, 1983a ).
Crocidura olivieri (Lesson, 1827) . Manuel de Mammalogie, p. 121 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Sakkara; the neotype designated by Corbet (1978c:30) was collected "near Giza " . DISTRIBUTION: Egypt ; Senegal to Ethiopia , and southwards to N South Africa . SYNONYMS: anchietae, atlantis, bueae, cara, daphnia, darfurea, deltae, ferruginea, fuscosa, giffardi, guineensis, doriana, hansruppi, hedenborgiana, hera, herero, kijabae, kivu, luluana, manni, martiensseni, nyansae, occidentalis , odorata, spurelli, sururae, tatiana, toritensis, zuleika. COMMENTS: Crocidura olivieri is the valid name for the large African shrews previously known as flavescens (which is now the valid name for a species restricted to South Africa ); see Maddalena et al. (1987) . This group of giant shrews was reviewed by Heim de Balsac and Barloy (1966) . Well known subspecies names are anchietae, doriana, ferruginea, fuscosa, giffardi, guineensis, hansruppi, hedenborgiana, kivu, manni, martiensseni, nyansae, occidentalis , odorata, spurelli, and sururae. Some of these were considered allospecies of a flavescens superspecies by Hutterer and Happold (1983) . Many authors also distinguished pale ( occidentalis , manni, spurelli) and black (giffardi, hedenborgiana, martiensseni, odorata) color morphs as different species but biochemical evidence showed that they are merely color morphs of a single and highly variable species (Maddalena, 1990). Crocidura olivieri may also include zaphiri ; see Yalden et al. (1976) .
Crocidura obscurior Heim de Balsac, 1958 . Mém. Inst. fr. Afr. noire, 53:328 . TYPE LOCALITY: Guinea , Mt. Nimba, montane prairie . DISTRIBUTION: Sierra Leone to Ivory Coast ; possibly Nigeria . COMMENTS: Described with some doubt as a subspecies of bottegi , but its almost sympatric distribution, a longer skull ( Hutterer and Happold, 1983 ), and a different karyotype (Maddalena, pers. comm.) clearly distinguish it.
Crocidura niobe Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:138 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , "Ruwenzori East, 6000 ft. " [= Mubukee Valley, 1828 m ]. DISTRIBUTION: Montane forests of EC Africa ( Uganda , Zaire ); perhaps Ethiopia . COMMENTS: Ethiopian records ( Corbet and Yalden, 1972 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ) uncertain; see Hutterer and Yalden (1990) .
Crocidura orii Kuroda, 1924 . [ New Mammals from the Ryukyu Islands], p. 3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan , Ryukyu Islands, Amami-Oshima, Komi . DISTRIBUTION: Ryukyu Isis, Japan . COMMENTS: Provisionally included in dsinezumi ( Corbet, 1978c ) ; but regarded as a separate species by Imaizumi (1961 , 1970b ), Abe (1967) , and Jenkins (1976) . The species was first described by Kuroda (1924) in a publication which, although privately published, has been regarded as available by all subsequent authors.
Crocidura palawanensis Taylor, 1934 . Monogr. Bur. Sci. Manila , 30:88 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Palawan , Sir J. Brooke Point . DISTRIBUTION: Palawan Isl, Philippines . COMMENTS: May belong to fuliginosa ( Heaney et al., 1987 ).

DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. Has not been collected since its discovery. COMMENTS: Considered a full species by Dippenaar and Meester (1989) . Related to harenna ; see discussion in Hutterer and Yalden (1990) .
Crocidura pergrisea Miller, 1913 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 26:113 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kashmir, Baltistan, Shigar, Skoro Loomba, 9,500 ft. ( 2900 m ) . DISTRIBUTION: Mountains of W Himalaya (Kashmir). COMMENTS: Some authors have included armenica , serezkyensis , and zarudnyi (see Spitzenberger, 1971, and Corbet, 1978c , for a review of literature); but all are now considered separate species. A considerable diversity of opinions exists in the literature on the allocation of the different forms. Following Jenkins (1976) , the name pergrisea is applied only to the largest species, as represented by the type series from Baltistan.
Crocidura pasha Dollman, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 15:517 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Atbara River, Sudan ." DISTRIBUTION: Sudan and Sahelian savanna of Sudan ; a single record from Ethiopia (Demeter, 1982). COMMENTS: Often confused with nanilla and lusitania ; does not include glebula which is a synonym of fuscomurina or planiceps ; see Hutterer and Kock (1983) and Hutterer and Happold (1983) .
Crocidura religiosa (I. Geoffroy, 1827) . Mem. Mus . Hist. Nat. Paris, 15:128 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Giza . DISTRIBUTION: Nile Valley ( Egypt ). COMMENTS: Described from embalmed specimens from tombs at Thebes; holotype not preserved. Corbet (1978c:27) selected a neotype from Giza .
Crocidura raineyi Heller, 1912 . Smithson. Mise. Coll. 60(12):7 -8. TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , "North Creek, Mt. Garguez" . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: Since its description C. raineyi has been considered a valid species, but was synonymized in 1977 with C. luna , an error recently corrected by Dippenaar and Meester (1989) .
Crocidura seiina Dollman, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 16:371 -372. TYPE LOCALITY: "Mabira Forest, Chagwe, Uganda ." DISTRIBUTION: Known only from three lowland forests in Uganda .

Crocidura russula (Hermann, 1780) . In Zimmermann, Geogr. Gesch. Mensch. Vierf. Thiere, 2:382 . TYPE LOCALITY: France , Bas Rhin, near Strasbourg . DISTRIBUTION: S and W Europe including some Atlantic island off France ; Mediterranean islands (Ibiza, Sardinia, Pantelleria?); N Africa ( Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia ). SYNONYMS: albiventris , agilis, anthonyi, candidus, chaouianensis, chrysothorax, cinereus , cintrae, constrictus, fimbriatus, foucauldi, heljanensis, hydruntina, ibicensis, ichnusae, inodorus, leucurus, major , moschata , musaraneus, peta, poliogastra, pulchra, rufa, safii, thoracicus, unicolor, yebalensis. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Genoud and Hutterer (1990) . The species is confined to W Europe and N Africa. Many populations from Asia and even Africa have been erroneously assigned to russula (see Ellermann and Morrison-Scott, 1951). Allozyme and karyotype analyses by Catzeflis et al. (1985) have shown that animals from E Europe, Asia Minor and Israel formerly identified as russula instead belong to suaveolens . This may also be true for other populations further east. Does not include hosletti, rapax, or vorax (see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1966:81 ; Jameson and Jones, 1977:465 ), which are here included in dsinezumi and pullata , respectively. May include cossyrensis ; see under that species.
Crocidura roosevelti (Heller, 1910) . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 56(15):6 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Lado Enclave , Rhino Camp .

Crocidura pullata Miller, 1911 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 24:241 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kashmir, Kotihar, 7,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Kashmir, India , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Yunnan ( China ), Thailand , full range unknown. SYNONYMS: rapax, vorax. COMMENTS: The name pullata is provisonally used as a label to include the Asian populations of what has been called russula by Jenkins (1976) and many other authors. It can be seen from the measurements provided by Jameson and Jones (1977) that the forms pullata , rapax and vorax differ from the European russula by a longer tail; all have been assigned to the West European species; see Lekagul and McNeely (1977) , among others.
Crocidura suaveolens (Pallas, 1811) . Zoogr. Rosso- Asiat., 1:133 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Crimea, Khersones, near Sevastopol . DISTRIBUTION: Entire Palearctic from Spain to Korea ; Atlantic islands (Scilly, Jersey , Sark, Ushant, Yeu); many Mediterranean islands including Corsica , Crete, Cyprus , and Menorca ; Tsushima and Ullong Do between Korea and Japan . SYNONYMS: antipae, ariadne, astrabadensis, avicennai, balcanica, balearica, bruecheri, cantanbra, caneae, cassiteridum, coreae, corsicana, cypria, cyrnensis, debeauxi, dinniki, enezsizunensis, heptapotamica, hyrcania, iculisma, ilensis, italica, lar, lignicolor, longicauda, mimula, mimuloides, minuta , monacha, mordeni, oayensis, orientis, pamirensis, phaeopus, portali, praecypria, sarda, shantungensis, tristami, utsuryoensis, uxantisi. COMMENTS: A widespread and variable species which has often been confused with russula ; the taxonomic status of many E Asian forms is still unsolved; see also under gueldenstaedtii . The European and Arabian range was reviewed by Vlasâk and Niethammer (1990) and Harrison and Bates (1991) , respectively; a discussion of suaveolens in Korea and Taiwan was given by Jones and Johnson (1960) and Jameson and Jones (1977) .
Crocidura stenocephala Heim de Balsac, 1979 . Säugetierkdl. Mitt., 27:258 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Zaire , "Kahuzi-Biega N.P." DISTRIBUTION: Montane Cyperus swamps at Mt. Kahuzi, E Zaire .

Crocidura serezkyensis Laptev, 1929 . Opred. Mlekopitay. Sredney Asyy, Tashkent, 1:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Tadshikistan, Pamir Mtns, Lake Sarezskoye . DISTRIBUTION: Asia Minor , Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tadshikistan and Kazakhstan. SYNONYMS: arispa. COMMENTS: Previously included in pergrisea (Spitzenberger, 1971; Jenkins, 1976 ), but considered a distinct species by Stogov and Bondar (1966) and Stogov (1985) . Populations in Asia Minor (arispa Spitzenberger, 1971) are linked with the typical ones in Kazakhstan and Tadshikistan by records from Azerbaijan (Grafodatsky et al., 1988) and Turkmenistan ( Stogov and Bondar, 1966 ). Grafodatsky et al. (1988) reported on the karyotype of a specimen from Dzhulfa, SW Azerbaijan (under the name pergrisea ); with 2n=22 serezkyensis has the lowest chromosome number ever recorded for a shrew.

Crocidura zarudnyi Ognev, 1928 . [ Mammals of Eastern Europe and Northern Asia], 1:341 . TYPE LOCALITY: Iran , Baluchistan (border) . DISTRIBUTION: SE Iran , SE Afghanistan , SW Pakistan (Spitzenberger, 1971). SYNONYMS: streetorum, tatianae. COMMENTS: The species was first named tatianae by Ognev (1921) , but later (1828) replaced by zarudnyi ; Ognev argued that tatianae was preoccupied by tatiana Dollman, 1915 (now a synonym of the African olivieri ). Strictly following the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (1985, art. 58), this is not the case, and zarudnyi would be an unjustified replacement name. However, since the species has always been called zarudnyi it would be justified to present the case to the commission in favor of stability. The definition of zarudnyi follows Spitzenberger (1971) and Hassinger (1970) , but not Jenkins (1976) who included arispa which is now regarded as part of serezkyensis ; see under that species. As Spitzenberger (1971) pointed out, zarudnyi has a shorter rostrum and a heavier mandible than both pergrisea and serezkyensis . The status of streetorum is not clear although it is included here as suggested by Hassinger (1970) . The distribution and morphology of pergrisea , serezkyensis , and zarudnyi should be carefully studied in the Hindukush, Karakoram and Pamir where their ranges may overlap.
Crocidura xantippe Osgood, 1910 . Field Mus . Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:19 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , " Voi, British East Africa " . DISTRIBUTION: Nyiru, Voi, Tsavo (SE Kenya) ; Usambara Mtns ( Tanzania ). COMMENTS: Status uncertain; probably related to hirta .

Myosorex geata (Allen and Loveridge, 1927) . Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., 38:417 . TYPE LOCALITY: Tanzania , Uluguru Mtns, Nyingwa . DISTRIBUTION: Forests of the Tanzania mountain arc. STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: Formerly in Crocidura ; see Heim de Balsac (1967:610) .
Myosorex Gray, 1838 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837: 124 [1838]. TYPE SPECIES: Sorex varius Smuts, 1832 . COMMENTS: Subfamily status uncertain. Repenning (1967) grouped Myosorex in the Crocidurinae ; Reumer's (1987) Crocidosoricinae would fit as well. Kretzoi (1965) based the tribe Myosoricini on this genus; the name is available for any taxonomic unit above the genus level. Generic status sometimes questioned; but see Meester (1954) . Surdisorex and Congosorex are often included as subgenera but are treated here as full genera, following Thomas (1906b) , Hollister (1918) , Meester (1953) , Heim de Balsac (1966b) , and my own studies. Partial reviews of Myosorex were provided by Heim de Balsac (1967 , 1968b ), Heim de Balsac and Lamotte (1956) , and Meester and Dippenaar (1978) . The formerly listed Myosorex preussi ( Matschie, 1893 ) , described from "Mount Cameroun ", is not listed here, because a recent examination of the type series has shown that the type series was based on mismatched parts of three different genera ( Crocidura , Sorex , Sylvisorex ), and that preussi does not represent a biological species. Species of conservation concern are listed in Nicoll and Rathbun (1990:21) .
Feroculus Kelaart, 1852 . Prodr. Faun. Zeylanica, p. 31 . TYPE SPECIES: Sorex macropus Blyth, 1851 (= Sorex feroculus Kelaart, 1850 ). COMMENTS: Repenning (1967:15) placed Feroculus in the subfamily Crocidurinae .
Myosorex eisentrauti Heim de Balsac, 1968 . Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 19:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Equatorial Guinea , Bioko, Pic Santa Isabel, 2400 m . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forest of Bioko ( Fernando Po ). STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: The forms okuensis and rumpii were included in eisentrauti by Heim de Balsac and Meester (1977) ; both are regarded as distinct species in this account.

Myosorex cafer (Sundevall, 1846) . Ofv. Kongl. Svenska Vet.-Akad. Forhandl. Stockholm , 3:119 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , "E Caffraria interiore et Port-Natal" . DISTRIBUTION: South Africa , eastern escarpment and north to the Transvaal; extreme W Mozambique and E Zimbabwe , in higher elevations above 1,000 m . SYNONYMS: swinnyi. COMMENTS: Meester (1958) described the geographic variation of the species. Heim de Balsac and Meester (1977) included affinis, sclateri , swinnyi, talpinus and tenuis in cafer , while Wolhuter (in Smithers, 1983:3 ) and Dippenaar et al. (1983) regarded sclateri and tenuis as distinct, partly based on new karyotype information. Although no additonal data have yet been published, this view is provisionally accepted here as it better reflects existing variation within the southern African representatives of the genus.
Myosorex blarina Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:139 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Ruwenzori East, Mubuku Valley, 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forest at Mt. Ruwenzori ( Uganda , Zaire ).

DISTRIBUTION: Wet habitats in Kwazulu ( South Africa ). SYNONYMS: affinis, talpinus. COMMENTS: Provisionally regarded as a distinct species by Wolhuter (in Smithers, 1983:3 ); occurs in sympatry with cafer and has a different karyotype. Meester et al. (1986) included sclateri in cafer .
Myosorex schalleri Heim de Balsac, 1966 . C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 263:889 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Zaire , Itombwe Mtns, "Nzombe (Mwenga)" . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: Provisionally named by Heim de Balsac (19666); full description by Heim de Balsac (1967) . The type locality was later erroneously shifted to the "Albert N. P." ( Heim de Balsac and Meester, 1977 ); Nzombe is located in the Itombwe Mountains ( Hutterer, 1986c ).

Myosorex rutnpii Heim de Balsac, 1968 . Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 19:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , "Rumpi-Hills, 1100 mètres" . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: The holotype and only known specimen is so unique (Heim de Balsac, 19686, fig. 4) that it is considered to represent a valid species. Heim de Balsac (19686) himself was uncertain about the status of this taxon; while he formally named it M. eisentrauti rumpii , he labeled all figures and the map with " Myosorex rumpii ".
Myosorex okuensis Heim de Balsac, 1968 . Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 19:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Bamenda Highlands, "Oku-See, 2100 m " . DISTRIBUTION: Forested mountains of the Bamenda plateau, Cameroon (Lake Manenguba, Lake Oku, Mt. Lefo). COMMENTS: Formerly included in eisentrauti (see Heim de Balsac and Meester, 1977 ), but cranially very distinct.
Nesophontes Anthony, 1916 . Bull. Am. Mus . Nat. Hist., 35:725 . TYPE SPECIES: Nesophontes edithae Anthony, 1916 . COMMENTS: All species of Nesophontes appear to have survived the late Pleistocene extinction, at least five species are known to have existed into post Columbian times, and several species apparently did not go extinct until the early part of this century ( Morgan and Woods, 1986 ). Includes an undescribed species from the Cayman Isis which was found in post-Columbian deposits ( Morgan and Woods, 1986 ; Varona, 1974 ).

Mesechinus Ognev, 1951 . Byull. Moskow . Ova. Ispyt. Prir. Otd. Biol., 56:8 . TYPE SPECIES: Erinaceus dauuricus Sundevall, 1842 . COMMENTS: Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987: 11) proposed to place Mesechinus as subgenus in Erinaceus while Corbet (1988: 163) included it in Hemiechinus . Most recently, Frost et al. (1991:30) concluded that Mesechinus deserves full generic status.
Subfamily Hylomyinae Anderson, 1879 . Anat. Zool. Res., Yunnan , 1:138 . SYNONYMS: Echinosoricinae, Galericinae, Gymnurinae. COMMENTS: Better known as Echinosoricinae or Galericinae; but see Frost et al. (1991:23) , whose taxonomic proposal is adopted here.
Echinosorex Blainville, 1838 . C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 6:742 . TYPE SPECIES: Viverra gymnura Raffles, 1822 . SYNONYMS: Gymnura . COMMENTS: Gymnura Lesson, 1827 , is preoccupied by Gymnura Kuhl, 1824 (a fish); see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951:17) and Medway (1977:15) .
Mesechinus hughi (Thomas, 1908) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1908(63):44 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Paochi, Shen-si" = Baoji, Shaanxi Prov. , China .

Echinosorex gymnura (Raffles, 1822) . Trans. Linn. Soc. London, 13:272 . TYPE LOCALITY: Not given; " Sumatra " implied . DISTRIBUTION: Malayan Peninsula, Borneo and Sumatra , Labuan island. SYNONYMS: albus, birmanica, borneotica, candida, minor , rafflesii. COMMENTS: Two subspecies, gymnura (Sumatra and Malay Peninsula) and albus (Borneo) are recognized; see Corbet (1988:128) . The common spelling of the specific epithet as gymnurus is incorrect; see Frost et al. (1991:24) .
Family Soricidae Fischer von Waldheim, 1817 . Mem. Soc. Imp. Nat. Moscow , 5:372 . SYNONYMS: Heterosoricidae . COMMENTS: Revised by Repenning (1967) and Gureev (1971 , 1979 ). For conflicting views of phylogeny, see Jammot (1983) , George (1986), and Reumer (1987) . Geological age currently believed to be Miocene, but recently the genera Cretasorex (Nesov and Gureev, 1981) from the Upper Cretaceous of Uzbekistan and Ernosorex ( Wang and Li, 1990 ) from the Eocene of China have been assigned to this family; while the former clearly represents a shrew the latter does not and may be a member of Plesiosoricidae . Currently accepted limits of subfamilies and tribes are very tentative. Most authors do not follow Reumer (1987) and include the extinct Heterosoricinae as a subfamily ( Engesser, 1975 ; Storch and Qiu, 1991 ), a view also accepted here. As a consequence, all living shrews as the sister group of Heterosoricidae should be classified in a single subfamily Soricinae , with Soricini and Crocidurini as tribes. However, as a convincing new phylogenetic system of fossil and living shrews has not yet been elaborated and as the application of two extant subfamilies proposed by Repenning (1967) is very much in use, it is provisionally applied here until new evidence has been presented.

DISTRIBUTION: Dinagat Island, Philippines . COMMENTS: Heaney and Morgan (1982) suggested "golden-spined gymnure" as an English name, but Poduschka and Poduschka (1985) argued that the stiff dorsal hairs are not always spiny and golden, and Corbet and Hill (1991: 27) suggested "spiny moonrat" as a common name. Heaney and Morgan (1982) considered that generic rank might be justified for this species but decided to include it in Podogymnura in order to emphasize the close relationship between the two species of Philippine gymnures; see also Corbet (1988:130-131) .

Subfamily Crocidurinae Milne-Edwards, 1872 . Rech. Hist. Nat. Mammifères, p. 256 . SYNONYMS: Crocidosoricinae, Myosoricinae. COMMENTS: Perhaps not a monophyletic group. Reumer (1987) postulated a new subfamily, Crocidosoricinae, for a number of fossil genera previously included in Crocidurinae . By application of the characters given for the new clade, a number of recent genera such as Congosorex , Myosorex and Surdisorex would go with it. The entire group is in need of revision.

Sigmodon peruanus J. A. Allen, 1897 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:118 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , La Libertad Dept., Trujillo, 200 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Pacific coastal plain and contiguous Andean foothills of W Ecuador and NW Peru . SYNONYMS: chonensis , lonnbergi, puna, simonsi. COMMENTS: Lumped under S. hispidus by Cabrera (1961) following the footnoted opinion of Hershkovitz (1955a) ; reinstated as a species by Voss (1992) .

Thalpomys cerradensis Hershkovitz, 1990 . J. Nat. Hist., 24:777 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Distrito Federal, Parque Nacional de Brasilia, 1100 m . DISTRIBUTION: Cerrado of C Brazil .
Sigmodontomys aphrastus (Harris, 1932) . Occas. Pap. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan , 248:5 . TYPE LOCALITY: Costa Rica , San José Prov., San Joaquin de Dota, 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality and Chiriqui Prov. , W Panama . COMMENTS: Usually listed as a species of Oryzomys of uncertain relationship ( Hall, 1981 ). Assignment to Sigmodontomys tentative following the observations of Ray (1962) . Distribution meagerly documented, known by only three specimens .
Sigmodontomys J. A. Allen, 1897 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:38 . TYPE SPECIES: Sigmodontomys alfari J. A. Allen, 1897 . COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. Named as a genus but later viewed as a synonym of Nectomys ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ), usually ranked as a subgenus ( Hershkovitz, 1944 ). Hershkovitz (1944:71) stressed the weakness of their association: "The apparent relationship of Sigmodontomys to Nectomys ... is probably attributable to an independant development...from the common oryzomyine stock rather than to a divergence from a...more recent Nectomys-like stock," an assessment later corroborated by other data ( Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964a ). Gardner and Patton (1976) formally transferred Sigmodontomys to a subgenus of Oryzomys , and we here provisionally list it as genus, noting the need to refine its relationships to Oryzomys proper .
Thalpomys Thomas, 1916 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 18:339 . TYPE SPECIES: Thalpomys lasiotis Thomas, 1916 (not Mus lasiotis of Lund, 1841 ). COMMENTS: Akodontine. Recognized as a genus, as initially diagnosed, by Gyldenstolpe (1932) ; reclassified as a subgenus of Akodon by Ellerman (1941) and so observed by Cabrera (1961). See Hershkovitz (1990a) for availability of genus-group name, its differentiating characters from typical Akodon , and definition of included species.
Scapteromys tumidus (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:15 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uruguay , Maldonado . DISTRIBUTION: Southernmost Brazil ( Rio Grande do Sul ), Uruguay and adjacent Argentina , E Paraguay . SYNONYMS: aquaticus . COMMENTS: Distribution and morphological identity reviewed by Hershkovitz (1966c) . Massoia and Fornes (1964) realigned aquaticus as a subspecies of S. tumidus . The taxonomic significance of the reported karyotypic differences between aquaticus and tumidus warrants re-examination (see Brum et al., 1973 , and Gentile de Fronza, 1970 ).
Rhipidomys mastacalis (Lund, 1840) . K. Dansk. Vid. Selsk. Naturv. Math. Afhandl., p. 24 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Rio das Velhas, Lagoa Santa . DISTRIBUTION: C and E Brazil , and perhaps Amazonian regions of Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru . SYNONYMS: cearanus, emiliae , macrurus , maculipes, yuruanus. COMMENTS: Degree of differentiation from the Andean forms latimanus and venezuelae unresolved; occurs in close proximity to a smaller species here listed as R. nitela . Distributional limits unclear. Zanchin et al. (1992a) considered cearanus as a species separate from R. mastacalis .
Rhipidomys nitela Thomas, 1901 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 8:148 . TYPE LOCALITY: Guyana , Kanuku Mountains, Kwaimatta, 240 ft . DISTRIBUTION: S Venezuela , Guianas, NC Brazil . SYNONYMS: fervidus, milleri , tobagi. COMMENTS: Previously listed either as a race of R. venezuelae ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ) or R. mastacalis (Cabrera, 1961) , but distinct from true venezuelae in Venezuela (see Handley, 1976 , who used the species name mastacalis ) and from R. mastacalis in N Brazil .
Rhipidomys scandens Goldman, 1913 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 60(22):8 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Darien Prov. , Mount Pirre, headwaters of Rio Limon, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the Serrania del Darien and Serrania de Pirre, easternmost Panama . COMMENTS: See remarks under R. latimanus .

COMMENTS: Placed as a subspecies of R. latimanus by Cabrera (1961) but distinct from the latimanus-venezuelae complex in Venezuela ( Handley, 1976 ).
Rhipidomys venezuelae Thomas, 1896 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:303 . TYPE LOCALITY: Venezuela , Merida , Merida , 1630 m . DISTRIBUTION: Mountains of N and W Venezuela and E Colombia . COMMENTS: This form may represent the E Andean complement of R. latimanus .
Rhipidomys ochrogaster J. A. Allen, 1901 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:43 TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., valley of Rio Inambari, Inca Mines , 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: SE Peru . COMMENTS: Retained as a species until judged the same as R. 1. leucodactylus by Cabrera (1961). Allen (1901 b) , however, specifically contrasted his new species with Peruvian R. leucodactylus . Geographic range and specific allies uncertain.
Scapteromys Waterhouse, 1837 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:20 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus tumidus Waterhouse, 1837 . COMMENTS: Scapteromyine. Hershkovitz (1966c) removed tomentosus and fronto to Kunsia , the presumed cognate genus of Scapteromys , and Massoia (1980a) transferred labiosus to Bibimys . Karyology summarized by Gardner and Patton (1976) .
Sigmodon Say and Ord, 1825 . J. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 4(2):352 . TYPE SPECIES: Sigmodon hispidus Say and Ord, 1825 . SYNONYMS: Deilemys , Lasiomys, Sigmomys . COMMENTS: North American forms revised by Bailey (1902) , with subsequent partial revisions by Baker (1969) , Voss (1992) , and Zimmerman (1970) ; further alphataxonomic study dearly needed. Standard karyology summarized by Zimmerman (1970) , banded karyotypes by Elder (1980) and Elder and Lee (1985) , albumin differentiation by Fuller et al. (1984) . Skin-skull morphology ( Bailey, 1902 ; Baker, 1969 ) and karyology ( Elder and Lee, 1985 ; Zimmerman, 1970 ) have yielded conflicting pictures of species-group associations. Sigmomys , type species Sigmodon alstoni , variously treated as a distinct genus ( Handley, 1976 ), a subgenus of Sigmodon ( Husson, 1978 ) , or a full synonym (Cabrera, 1961). Hershkovitz (1955a) arrayed Sigmodon with Holochilus , Neotomys , and Reithrodon as the sigmodont group, but other evidence has questioned the close affinity of each to Sigmodon (see those generic accounts).
Scolomys ucayalensis Pacheco, 1991 . Pubi. Mus. Hist, nat, Ser. A Zool., Univ. Nac. Mayor de San Marcos , 37:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Loreto Dept., 2.8 km E Jenaro Herrera, right bank of Ucayali River , 135 m ; 79°39'W , 04°52'S . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality.

Scolomys melanops Anthony, 1924 . Am. Mus. Novit., 139:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Pastaza Prov. , Mera, 3800 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the vicinity of the type locality.
Scolomys Anthony, 1924 . Am. Mus. Novit., 139:1 . TYPE SPECIES: Scolomys melanops Anthony, 1924 . COMMENTS: Rare in collections. Phylogenetic affinity not critically explored, although listed in tribe Oryzomyini ( Reig, 1984 ) .
Scotinomys Thomas, 1913 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 11:408 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys teguina Alston, 1877 . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Until diagnosed by Thomas, forms associated here had been affiliated with Akodon (e.g., Bangs, 1902 ). Revised by Hooper (1972) ; for other aspects of biology and systematics, see Hooper and Carleton (1976) , Carleton et al. (1975), and Rogers and Heske (1984) . Broadly affiliated with neotomine-peromyscines sensu Hooper and Musser (1964a) ; common ancestry with Baiomys proposed on the basis of morphological traits ( Hooper, 1960 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964b ; Carleton, 1980 ), a relationship weakened by karyological banding data ( Rogers and Heske, 1984 ).
Rheomys thomasi Dickey, 1928 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 41:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: El Salvador , San Miguel Dept., Finca San Felipe, Cerro Cacaguatique, 3500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: S Mexico , Guatemala , and El Salvador . SYNONYMS: chiapensis, stirtoni . COMMENTS: Of two named subspecies, Voss (1988) retained only stirtoni as a race.
Rheomys mexicanus Goodwin, 1959 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1967:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Oaxaca , Dist. Miahuatlan, San José Lachiguirl, 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Oaxaca , Mexico . COMMENTS: Viewed as closely related to R. underwoodi ( Voss, 1988 ) . Type species of Goodwin's (1959a) Neorheomys .

Rheomys underwoodi Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:422 . TYPE LOCALITY: Costa Rica , Cartago Prov. , near Très Rios . DISTRIBUTION: C Costa Rica and W Panama . COMMENTS: Viewed as closely related to R. mexicanus ( Voss, 1988 ) .
Reithrodontomys zacatecae Merriam, 1901 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 3:557 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Zacatecas , Sierra de Valparaiso . DISTRIBUTION: W Chihuahua to WC Michoacan , Mexico . SYNONYMS: obscurus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Reithrodontomys , megalotis species group. Hooper (1952) noted the phenetic distinction of zacatecae from R. megalotis saturatus in Jalisco and Michoacan but elected to retain it as a subspecies. Karyotypic divergence of zacatecae reported by Hood et al. (1984), who proposed its elevation to species. Distributional limits, morphological discrimination, and assignment of species-group synonyms deserve amplification.
Rheomys raptor Goldman, 1912 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 60:7 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Darién Prov. , Cerro Pirre, near headwaters of Rfo Limon, 4500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Costa Rica and Panama . SYNONYMS: hartmanni . COMMENTS: Treated as a subspecies of Rheomys trichotis (Cabrera, 1961) , but species status affirmed by Voss (1988) . Enders (1939) described hartmanni as a species; recognized as such (e.g., Hall, 1981 ) until Voss (1988) allocated the form to a subspecies of raptor .
Rheomys Thomas 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:421 . TYPE SPECIES: Rheomys underwoodi Thomas, 1906 . SYNONYMS: Neorheomys . COMMENTS: Ichthyomyine. All named forms suggested as conspecific under trichotis by Hershkovitz (1966b) but Voss (1988) recognized four species. Formerly included trichotis (Tate, 1932/t), a species later designated as the type of Chibchanomys ( Voss, 1988 ) . Neorheomys , diagnosed as a subgenus ( Goodwin, 1959a ), was placed in full synonymy by Voss (1988) . Separation from lchthyomys questioned by Ellerman (1941) and Hall (1981) ; relationships and generic stature illuminated by Voss (1988) .
Rhagomys Thomas, 1917 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 20: 192 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys rufescens Thomas, 1886 . COMMENTS: Generic affinities uncertain: originally allied with Oryzomys-Oecomys ( Thomas, 1917c ), or included among oryzomyine genera (Tate, 1932/), or listed as Sigmodontinae incertae sedis (Reig, 1980, 1984).
Rhipidomys leucodactylus (Tschudi, 1844) . Fauna Peruana, 1:183 . TYPE LOCALITY: Eastern Peru ; Cabrera (1961) suggested the type's origin from the upper Rio Huallaga, a restriction which should be considered by a future revisor . DISTRIBUTION: Guianas, S Venezuela , N Brazil , Ecuador , and Peru . SYNONYMS: aratayae, bovallii, equatoris, lucullus, modicus , ochrogaster , rex , sclateri. COMMENTS: Thomas (1887b) remarked that sclateri, named from British Guiana , was the eastern counterpart of Peruvian R. leucodactylus ; Guillotin and Petter (1984) described aratayae, a subspecies of R. leucodactylus , from French Guiana .
Rhipidomys latimanus (Tomes, 1860) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1860:213 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Chimborazo Prov. , Pallatanga, 1485 m . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forests of C and W Colombia and Ecuador . SYNONYMS: cocalensis, microtis , mollissimus, pictor. COMMENTS: This species may encompass Andean populations in E Colombia and Venezuela identified as R. venezuelae ( Handley, 1976 ) ; its status with regard to R. scandens and R. mastacalis also needs clarification. Cabrera (1961) arranged fulviventer and venustus as subspecies, but these two forms are distinct from one another and from the latimanus-venezuelae complex in Venezuela ( Handley, 1976 ). Karyotype reported by Gardner and Patton (1976) .
Rhipidomys fulviventer Thomas, 1896 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:304 . TYPE LOCALITY: Colombia , Cundinamarca Dept., Aqua Dulce, 2400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Andes of W Venezuela and Colombia . SYNONYMS: elatturus, microtis , tenuicauda . COMMENTS: Listed as a subspecies of R. latimanus by Cabrera (1961) but clearly a species separate from the latimanus-venezuelae complex in Venezuela ( Handley, 1976 ). Compared with R. wetzeli by Gardner (1989).
Rhipidomys caucensis J. A. Allen, 1913 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 32:601 . TYPE LOCALITY: Colombia , Cauca Dept., Munchique, 8225 ft . DISTRIBUTION: W Andes of Colombia .
Rhipidomys austrinus Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 7:183 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Jujuy Prov. , Sierra de Santa Barbara, Sunchai, 1200 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Andean slopes of SC Bolivia and NW Argentina . SYNONYMS: collinus . COMMENTS: Whether this form intergrades with R. leucodactylus , as usually identified (e.g., Mares et al., 1989b ), or with R. couesi deserves specimen-based corroboration.
Rhipidomys couesi (J. A. Allen and Chapman, 1893) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:214 . TYPE LOCALITY: Trinidad , Princes Town . DISTRIBUTION: Trinidad , Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru . SYNONYMS: cumananus, goodfellowi, modicus . COMMENTS: Cabrera (1961) identified couesi as a subspecies of R. sclateri. As emphasized by its original describer Thomas (1887b) , sclateri closely resembles Peruvian R. leucodactylus , and, in both Venezuela (see Handley, 1976 ) and Peru , R. couesi and R. leucodactylus are morphologically distinct.
Rhipidomys Tschudi, 1844 . Arch. Naturgesch., 10, 1:252 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys leucodactylus Tschudi, 1844 . COMMENTS: Thomasomyine. No critical synopsis of valid species exists apart from the original descriptions. Compared to the overly lumped classification of Cabrera (1961), Handley's (1976) regional listing reveals the greater species diversity within the genus, but how these Venezuelan forms relate to Rhipidomys populations inhabiting other parts of the Andes and Amazonia remains unknown. The following enumeration must be regarded as highly provisional and attempts to amalgamate the differing viewpoints of Cabrera (1961), Gyldenstolpe (1932) , and Handley (1976) . Species distributions are in general poorly documented. Preliminary karyotypic surveys provided by Gardner and Patton (1976) and Zanchin et al. (1992a) .

COMMENTS: Subgenus Reithrodontomys , megalotis species group. Formerly included R. zacatecae , which Hood et al. (1984) identified as a separate species. The substantial chromosomal variation reported (see Engstrom et al., 1981) cautions that other species may be lumped under R. megalotis . See Webster and Jones (1982a , Mammalian Species, 167).
Reithrodontomys humulis (Audubon and Bachman, 1941) . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 1:97 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , South Carolina , Charleston Co., Charleston .

DISTRIBUTION: Salt marshes around San Francisco Bay, California , USA . STATUS: U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered. SYNONYMS: halicoetes . COMMENTS: Subgenus Reithrodontomys , megalotis species group. Morphological and chromosomal differentiation between the subspecies raviventris and halicoetes thought to represent terminal stages of speciation ( Fisler, 1965 ; Shellhammer, 1967 ). Banded chromosomes and genic data reveal sister-group relationship to R. montanus (Hood et al., 1984; Nelson et al., 1984 ). See Shellhammer (1982 , Mammalian Species, 169).

Spalax graecus Nehring, 1898 . Zool. Anz., 21:228 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ukraine , Bukovina region, vicinity of Chernovtsy (as restriced by Topachevskii, 1969 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Romania and SW Ukraine (see Topachevskii, 1969 ; Savie, 19824). SYNONYMS: antiquus , istricus , mezosegiensis . COMMENTS: Included in S. microphthalmus by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c) , but arranged as a distinctive species by Topachevskii (1969) and so listed by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Savie (19824) reviewed in detail the European segment. Topachevskii (1969) recognized istricus , apparently restricted to Rumania , as a subspecies, and Murariu and Torcea (1984) separated it as a species based on cranial traits. Their sample, however, was small, and variation of the traits believed to discriminate istricus from S. graecus should be reassessed using larger samples from both Rumania and the Ukraine .
Spalax zemni Erxleben, 1777 . Syst. Regni Anim., 1:370 -371. TYPE LOCALITY: Ukraine , Ternopolsk region (see Topachevskii, 1969 ) . DISTRIBUTION: SE Poland east into Ukraine between Dnestr and Dnepr rivers and south to margin of Black Sea (see Topachevskii, 1969 ; Savie, 1982c; Vorontsov et al., 1977b ). SYNONYMS: podolicus, polonicus . COMMENTS: Included in S. microphthalmus by Corbet (1978c) , but monographed as a separate species (under the name polonicus ) by Topachevskii (1969) and listed as such by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Reviewed (as polonicus ) by Savie (1982c). Topachevskii (1969) indicated that zemni was a nomen nudum , but it is properly available ( Ellerman, 1949b ) and becomes the earliest name for this species ( Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ).
Spalax microphthalmus Guldenstaedt, 1770 . Nova Comm. Acad. Sci. Petropoli, 14:1 TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Voronezhskaya Oblast, Novokhoper Steppe . DISTRIBUTION: Steppes in Ukraine and S Russia between Dnieper and Volga rivers, north to Orel-Kursk line, and south to Ciscaucasia (see Topachevskii, 1969 ; Vorontsov et al., 1977b ). SYNONYMS: pallosi, typhlus . COMMENTS: Monographed by Topachevskii (1969) and maintained as a species by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) .
Nannospalax leucodon Nordmann, 1840 . Demidoff Voy., 3:34 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ukraine , near Odessa . DISTRIBUTION: From Yugoslavia through Hungary , Rumania , Bulgaria , Greece , and extreme NW Turkey , to SW Ukraine just east of Dnestr River in Odessa region (see Vorontsov, 1977b ; Savie, 1982b). SYNONYMS: ceylanus, epiroticus, hellenicus, hercegovinensis, hungaricus, insularis , makedonicus, martinoi, montanoserbicus, montanosyrmiensis, monticola , ovchepolensis, peloponnesiacus, serbicus, strumiciensis, syrmiensis, thermaicus, thessalicus, thracius, transsylvanicus , turcicus, vasvdrii. COMMENTS: This species was morphologically characterized by Topachevskii (1969) and is now viewed as a superspecies based on chromosomal studies ( Giagia et al., 1982 ; Peshev, 1983 ; Savie, 1982b; Savie and Nevo, 1990; Savie and Soldatovic, 1977, 1979). Savie (1982b) delineated six clusters that he interpreted as chromosomal species: leucodon group (with hungaricus, montanosyrmiensis, monticola , and transsylvanicus ), makedonicus group, strumiciensis group (with ovchepolensis and serbicus), epiroticus (with hellenicus), turcicus group (with thracius), and montanoserbicus group (with hercegovinensis and syrmiensis). Mikes et al. (1982) analysed the pelvis of N. leucodon in the context of assessing sexual dimorphism and taxonomic differences. Morphological and biometric analyses by Kivanc (1988) indicated that N. leucodon occurs in most of Turkey (subspecies anatolicus , armeniacus, cilicicus , nehringi , and turcicus) and that N. ehrenbergi extends up into SW Turkey (subspecies intermedius and kirgisorum ). However, Savie and Nevo (1990) viewed these results skeptically and urged elucidation by chromosomal evidence. Available biochemical and chromosomal data clearly do not support the conspecificity of leucodon and nehringi ( Vorontsov et al., 1977b , and references therein).
Nannospalax ehrenbergi (Nehring, 1898) . Sitzb. Ges. Naturf. Fr. Berlin (for December, 1897), 178, pl. 2 [1898]. TYPE LOCALITY: Israel , Jaffa . DISTRIBUTION: From Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , and Israel through N Egypt to N Libya (see Lay and Nadler, 1972 , for North African range); possibly SW Turkey (Savie and Nevo, 1990). SYNONYMS: aegyptiacus , berytensis , fritschi, intermedius , kirgisorum . COMMENTS: Chromosomal data for North African populations provided by Lay and Nadler (1972) . Libyan populations reviewed by Ranck (1968) and those in Egypt by Osborn and Helmy (1980) . For more than 30 years, Israeli populations of this "superspecies" have been the subjects of intensive research concerning evolutionary theory and the processes of speciation and adaptive radiation (see Nevo, 1991 ).
Subfamily Spalacinae Gray, 1821 . London Med. Repos., 15:303 . SYNONYMS: Aspalacidae . COMMENTS: Taxonomy and distribution reviewed by Ognev (1963a) and Corbet (1978c , 1984 ); subfamily monographed by Topachevskii (1969) . For an introduction to morphology, taxonomy, and paleontology of European species, see Savie (1982a) and Kivanc (1988) . Carleton and Musser (1984) provided a diagnosis of the subfamily and summarized general characters, distribution, taxonomy, and fossils; and Savie and Nevo (1990) gave an excellent synopsis of the evolutionary history, speciation, and population biology of mole rats. Catzeflis et al. (1989) used DNA-DNA hybridization to compare spalacines with arvicolines and murines to estimate their time of divergence. Vorontsov et al. (1977b) distinguished four species groups based upon biochemical data: N. nehringi , N. leucodon , S. microphthalmus , and the last containing S. graecus , S. polonicus , S. arenarius , and S. giganteus . The species defined biochemically are the same as those defined by Ognev (1963a) and Topachevskii (1969) using morphological traits and by Lyapunova et al. (1974) with chromosomal evidence. To these seven species is added N. ehrenbergi . Although Savie and Nevo (1990:133) acknowledged eight extant species, they concluded that the systematics is unrealistic because "it is based primarily on classical morphology, ignoring the central phenomenon of Spalacid evolution, i.e., chromosomal speciation which suggests that more than 30 living karyotypes, or species have been described and the end is not yet in sight." Results from sequencing alpha crystalline A chain, a lens protein of the eye in Spalax , and its significance for molecular clock hypothesis and phenetic analysis was discussed by McKenna (1992) .
Nannospalax Palmer, 1903 . Science, n.s., 17:873 . TYPE SPECIES: Spalax kirgisorum Nehring, 1898 (= Spalax ehrenbergi Nehring, 1898 ). SYNONYMS: Mesospalax, Microspalax (of Mehely, 1909 , not Megnin and Trouessart, 1885 ), Ujhelyiana . COMMENTS: The species were monographed under the genus Microspalax Mehely, 1909 , by Topachevskii (1969) . Mehely's generic name, however, is preoccupied and that is why Nannospalax , as well as Ujhelyiana , were proposed. Nannospalax is differentiated from Spalax by a suite of skeletal and dental traits ( Topachevskii, 1969 ). Compared with species of Spalax, karyotypes of those in Nannospalax have low diploid and fundamental numbers and exhibit significant interpopulational differences that correlate with biological and ecological distinctions. Such properties have led investigators to suspect that the three entities listed below are superspecies, each made up of separate biological species (Savie and Nevo, 1990).
Spalax giganteus Nehring, 1898 . Sitzb. Ges. Naturf. Fr. Berlin , p. 169 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Daghestan , W shore of Caspian Sea, near MakhachKaly . DISTRIBUTION: Isolated populations in steppes NW of the Caspian Sea and in Kazakhstan between the Volga River and W margin of the Caspian Sea between the Dnepr and Ural rivers (see Topachevskii, 1969 ; Vorontsov et al., 1977b ). SYNONYMS: uralensis . COMMENTS: Revised by Topachevskii (1969) and listed as a separate species by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Geographic range is parapatric with that of S. microphthalmus ( Corbet, 1978c ) .
Spalax arenarius Reshetnik, 1939 . Reports Zool. Mus. Kiev , 23:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ukraine , Nikolaev Region, Golaya Pristan, NW shore of Black Sea . DISTRIBUTION: Small range in S Ukraine (see Vorontsov et al., 1977b ). COMMENTS: Listed as a subspecies of S. microphthalmus by Corbet (1978c) , but elevated to species by Topachevskii (1969) and recognized as such by Lyapunova et al. (1974) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Topachevskii (1969) viewed the restricted geographic range of S. arenarius as a relictual distribution.
Nannospalax nehringi (Satunin, 1898) . Zool. Anz., 21:314 . TYPE LOCALITY: Armenia , Kasikoporan . DISTRIBUTION: Turkey , Armenia , and Georgia (see Topachevskii, 1969 ; Vorontsov et al., 1977b ). SYNONYMS: anatolicus , armeniacus, captorum, cilicicus , corybantium. COMMENTS: Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c) listed nehringi as a synonym of S. leucodon , but Topachevskii (1969) treated it as a distinct species (under subgenus Mesospalax , genus Microspalax ), a revision followed by Corbet (1984) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Topachevskii (1969) included turcicus in the synonymy of this species, but Savie (1982b) placed it in leucodon . Morphometric analyses have been interpreted to indicate that nehringi and its synonyms are geographic variants of N. leucodon (see Kivanc, 1988 ; Savie and Nevo, 1990, and account of leucodon ).
Spalax Guldenstaedt, 1770 . Nova Comm. Acad. Sci. Petropoli, ser. 14, 1:410 . TYPE SPECIES: Spalax microphthalmus Guldenstaedt, 1770 . SYNONYMS: Anotis , Aspalax , Macrospalax , Myospalax (of Hermann, 1783 , not Laxmann, 1769), Ommatostergus, Talpoides . COMMENTS: Peshev (1989a , b) illuminated interspecific differences among the five species, as well as sexual dimorphism within each, using morphometric techniques. Compared with Nannospalax , karyotypic characteristics of Spalax species include high diploid and fundamental numbers, no acrocentric chromosomes, smaller interspecific differences in karyotypic structure, and lack of significant interpopulation variation (Savie and Nevo, 1990).

COMMENTS: Goodwin (1934) passingly noted that La Primavera (Dept. Alto Verapaz) may be the type locality, a restriction which should be formally considered by a future revisor. Goodwin (1969) relegated gymnurus to a subspecies of T. nudicaudus .
Tylomys fulviventer Anthony, 1916 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 35:366 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Darien Prov. , Tacarcuna, 4200 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Easternmost Panama . COMMENTS: Possibly a subspecies of T. mirae according to Cabrera (1961) or a synonym of T. panamensis according to Handley (1966a) .

Tylomys Peters, 1866 . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , 1866:404 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys nudicaudus Peters, 1866 . COMMENTS: Tribal-level membership unresolved; closely related to Ototylomys (see remarks under same). Basic revision much needed; forms listed follow Hall (1981:626) , who remarked that "study...may show that some of the species are only subspecies."
Zygodontomys brevicauda (J. A. Allen and Chapman, 1893) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:215 . TYPE LOCALITY: Trinidad , Princes Town .

DISTRIBUTION: NE Argentina and SE Brazil . COMMENTS: Provisionally assigned to Wilfredomys on the assertions of Osgood (1933b) and Pine (1980b) that pictipes is most closely related to oenax .
Wilfredomys Avila-Pires, 1960 . Bol. Mus. Nac., Nov. Ser., Rio de Janeiro , 220:3 . TYPE SPECIES: Thomasomys oenax Thomas, 1928 . COMMENTS: Genus diagnosed to encompass another problematic thomasomyine species from SE Brazil ; see Osgood (1933b) and Pine (1980b) for historical review of the generic affiliations of the type species. The categorical recognition of this taxon, conventionally treated as a subgenus of Thomasomys (e.g., Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Pine, 1980b ), will depend on phylogenetic studies involving other thomasomyines (also see comments under Delomys ).
Zygodontomys J. A. Allen, 1897 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:38 . TYPE SPECIES: Oryzomys cherriei J. A. Allen, 1895 (= Oryzomys brevicauda J. A. Allen and Chapman, 1893 ). COMMENTS: First revised by Hershkovitz (1962) , then thought to include southern populations now allocated to Bolomys lasiurus (see Maia and Langguth, 1981 ; Reig, 1987; Voss and Linzey, 1981 ). Definition of genus emended and species taxonomy revised by Voss (1991a) ; Reig (in Reig et al., 1990a ) listed four species as valid. Karyology summarized by Gardner and Patton (1976) and Reig et al. (1990a) . Hershkovitz (1962) considered Zygodontomys a member of the phyllotine group, an association disputed by other studies ( Hooper and Musser, 1964a ; Olds and Anderson, 1989 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ). Unsettled phylogenetic position expressed as Sigmodontinae incertae sedis ( Reig, 1984 ; Voss, 1991a ).

DISTRIBUTION: Intermediate to high elevations in mountains of S Chiapas , Mexico , and SW Guatemala . SYNONYMS: altilaneus . COMMENTS: Morphological variation and distribution clarified by Huckaby (1980) . Level of relationship to morphologically similar allopatric forms P. grandis and P. zarhynchus unresolved. Status of altilaneus problematic: synonymized under guatemalensis by Huckaby (1980 ; also see Carleton and Huckaby, 1975 ) but listed as a species by Hall (1981) , who followed Osgood (1909) . Carleton (1989) noted cranial resemblance of altilaneus to P. mexicanus . P. mexicanus species group.
Peromyscus leucopus (Rafinesque, 1818) . Am. Mon . Mag., 3:446 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Kentucky , "pine barrens," presumably near mouth of Ohio River . DISTRIBUTION: C and E USA , excluding Florida; northwards to S Alberta and to S Ontario , Quebec and Nova Scotia , Canada ; southwards to N Durango and along Caribbean coast to Isthmus of Tehuantepec and NW Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico . SYNONYMS: affinis , amnwdytes, arboreus , aridulus , arizonae , brevicaudus , campestris , canus , castaneus , caudatus , cozulmelae , easti, emmonsi , flaccidus, fuscus , incensus, lachiguiriensis, mearnsii , mesomelas , michiganensis , minnisotae, myoides , musculoides , noveboracensis , ochraceus , texanus, torniilo. COMMENTS: Revised by Osgood (1909) . Distinctive northeastern ( leucopus ) and southwestern (texanus) cytotypes reported (R. J. Baker et al., 1983b ), with introgression across hybrid zone in central Oklahoma ( Nelson et al., 1987 ; Stangl, 1986 ; Stangl and Baker, 1984a ).

Peromyscus levipes Merriam, 1898 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 12:123 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Tlaxcala , Mount Malinche, 8400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Mexico —from E Nayarit to C Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas , south through mountains of Oaxaca and Chiapas —to highlands of Guatemala , El Salvador , and Honduras . SYNONYMS: ambiguus, beatae , sacarensis, sagax . COMMENTS: Systematic studies have confirmed sympatry of P. boylii rowleyi and P. levipes in Queretaro and Hidalgo and supported its elevation to species ( Houseal et al., 1987 ; Rennert and Kilpatrick, 1987 ; Schmidly et al., 1988 ). The taxon baetae was provisionally retained by Carleton (1989) under P. levipes , whereas Schmidly et al. (1988) viewed it as a cryptic species distinct from P. levipes (including ambiguus— but see Bradley et al., 1989 ). The status and distributional extent of these taxa and other chromosomal forms deserve attention (see Bradley et al., 1989 ; Houseal et al., 1987 ; Smith et al., 1989 ). P. boylii species group.

COMMENTS: Status and relationships with regard to P. melanotis addressed by Bowers et al. (1973) , Bowers (1974) , and Greenbaum and Baker (1978) ; to P. oreas by Allard et al. (1987) , Allard and Greenbaum (1988) , and Gunn and Greenbaum (1986) ; and to P. polionotus by Avise et al. (1979) and Robbins and Baker (1981) . Distinction between short-tailed and long-tailed geographic races (e.g., Hooper, 1968b ; Koh and Peterson, 1983 ) obscurely reflected in chromosomal and biochemical data ( Avise et al., 1979 ; Bowers et al., 1973 ; Bradshaw and Hsu, 1972 ; Calhoun et al., 1988 ; Lansman et al., 1983 ). Specific homogeneity of included taxa doubtful. P. maniculatus species group.

DISTRIBUTION: W Chihuahua and SE Coahuila , south to C Oaxaca , Mexico . SYNONYMS: amplus , felipensis , petricola, saxicola . COMMENTS: Revised by Hoffmeister and de la Torre (1961) to include nasutus (see species account below) and comanche (transferred to P. truei — Schmidly, 1973b ). Karyologic and biochemical evidence has suggested that P. difficilis and P. nasutus are sibling species ( Avise et al., 1979 ; Zimmerman et al., 1975 , 1978 ); classified as such by Carleton (1989), but see Janecek (1990) .

COMMENTS: Revised by Osgood (1909) ; subspecific taxonomy updated by Hall and Hoffmeister (1942) . Initially placed in subgenus Haplomylomys ( Osgood, 1909 ) ; later transferred to subgenus Peromyscus ( Hooper and Musser, 1964b ) . Karyotype viewed as primitive for the genus ( Greenbaum and Baker, 1978 ; Stangl and Baker, 1984b ). Specific homogeneity questionable. P. crinitus species group.

DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Monserrate Island . COMMENTS: Relationship to P. eva highlighted by Lawlor (1971«, b), who suggested its possible ranking as a subspecies thereof but later (1983) maintained it as an insular species. Hall (1981) listed P. caniceps in the crinitus species group without explanation. P. eremicus species group.

COMMENTS: Relationships of P. eremicus to various insular forms in Gulf of California elucidated by Lawlor (1971a, b; 1983), who relegated collatus to a subspecies. Genetic variation surveyed by Avise et al. (1974b) , who noted differentiation of eremicus populations east and west of the Colorado River . Once included P. merriami (see Hoffmeister and Lee, 1963 ) and P. eva (see Lawlor, 1971a). See Veal and Caire (1979 , Mammalian Species, 118). P. eremicus species group.

SYNONYMS: allapaticola, anastasae , cognatus , insulanus , nigriculus , megacephalus , mississippiensis, palmarius, restrictus, telmaphilus. COMMENTS: Hybridization in lab with P. leucopus ( Bradshaw, 1968 ) , but differentiation of P. gossypinus in field is well documented (Engstrom et al., 1982; Price and Kennedy, 1980 ; L. W. Robbins et al., 1985). See Wolfe and Linzey (1977 , Mammalian Species, 70). P. leucopus species group.

SYNONYMS: carmeni. COMMENTS: Ranked by Osgood (1909) as a race of P. eremicus , but Lawlor (1971a), noting morphological differences and sympatry of the two, resurrected P. eva as a species. P. eremicus species group.
Oxymycterus hucucha Hinojosa, Anderson, and Patton, 1987 . Am. Mus. Novit., 2898:15 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , Cochabamba Dept., 28 km (by road) W Comarapa, 2800 m ; 17°51'S , 64°40'W . DISTRIBUTION: Vicinity of type locality. COMMENTS: Morphologically similar to O. hiska .

DISTRIBUTION: NE Argentina (Misiones) and SE Brazil . COMMENTS: Formerly included in Microxus or Akodon (e.g., Cabrera, 1961; Ellerman, 1941 ); reallocated to Oxymycterus by Massoia (1963b) and morphological recognition amplified by Massoia and Fornes (1969) .
Oxymycterus hispidus Pictet, 1843 . Mem. Soc. Phys. Hist. Nat. Geneve , 10:212 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Bahia . DISTRIBUTION: NE Argentina (Misiones) to E Brazil ( Bahia ). SYNONYMS: judex, misionalis, quaestor .
Oxymycterus rufus (Fischer, 1814) . Zoognosia, 3:71 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , 32.5°S latitude along lower Rio Parana . DISTRIBUTION: EC Argentina , Uruguay , and SE Brazil . SYNONYMS: dasytrichus , platensis, rostellatus, rutilans . COMMENTS: Priority of Mus rufus Fischer, 1814 , over Mus rutilans Olfers, 1818 , both based on Azara's (1801) descriptions, deserves formal stabilization as does clarification of the morphological identity of the species with Azara's "rat roux." Karyotypes of O. rufus and platensis support their union as one species ( Vitullo et al., 1986 ). Level of relationship to other nominal species and range limits uncertain. Cabrera (1961) cited Rengger (1830) for the placement of the type locality near Asunción , Paraguay , as it is usually given. Rengger's basis for this interpretation is unclear since Azara (1802) mentioned collecting the species in an arroyo at 32.5 degrees, presumably south latitude, which places the locality somewhere in southern Entre Rios province near the Rio Parana. The origin of the larger, rufescent O. rufus from this region seems more plausible than around Asunción where the smaller, dark-colored O. delator occurs (see Myers, 1982 ). A future revisor should clarify this discrepancy.
Oxymycterus roberti Thomas, 1901 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 8:530 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Rio Jordao, Paranaiba, 700- 900 m . DISTRIBUTION: Vicinity of type locality.

DISTRIBUTION: Upper E Andean slopes in SE Peru , WC Bolivia , and NW Argentina . SYNONYMS: jacentior, nigrifrons . COMMENTS: Genetic distance data relative to other akodonts presented by Hinojosa et al. (1987) . Placement of jacentior with this species merits reconsideration.
Oxymycterus nasutus (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uruguay , Maldonado . DISTRIBUTION: Uruguay and adjacent SE Brazil . COMMENTS: Comparisons with O. iheringi provided by Massoia and Fornes (1969) ; they (and Vitullo et al., 1986 ) further noted the distinction of O. nasutus from O. rufus , under which it had been ranked as a subspecies (Cabrera, 1961). Range limits unknown.
Oxymycterus inca Thomas, 1900 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 6:298 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Junin Dept., Rio Perene, 800 m . DISTRIBUTION: SC Peru to WC Bolivia . SYNONYMS: doris, iris, juliacae. COMMENTS: Distributional extent uncertain; identity of Oxymycterus populations in Amazon Basin with this species requires substantiation.
Peromyscus attwateri J. A. Allen, 1895 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 7:330 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Texas , Kerr Co., Turtle Creek . DISTRIBUTION: Edwards Plateau of NC Texas , north through E Oklahoma , to SE Kansas , SW Missouri , and NW Arkansas , USA . SYNONYMS: bellus , cansensis, laceyi . COMMENTS: Classified as a geographic race of P. boylii ( Osgood, 1909 ) until rediagnosed as a species by Schmidly (1973a) . Biochemical evolution studied by Kilpatrick (1984) . Cognate relationship to P. difficilis suggested by Janecek (1990) . See Schmidly (1974a , Mammalian Species, 48). P. boylii species group.
Peromyscus aztecus (Saussure, 1860) . Rev. Mag. Zool. Paris, Ser. 2, 12: 105 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Veracruz , vicinity of Mirador . DISTRIBUTION: Intermediate to high altitudes from S Jalisco and C Veracruz , Mexico , through highlands of Guatemala , to Honduras and N El Salvador . SYNONYMS: cordillerae, evides, hondurensis , hylocetes , oaxacensis . COMMENTS: Traditionally viewed as a subspecies of P. boylii ( Osgood, 1909 ) . Species status recognized by Alvarez (1961) ; morphological recognition, distribution, and synonymies clarified by Musser (1969a) and Carleton (1979). Several of the junior synonyms (evides, hylocetes , oaxacensis ) have been treated as species ( Hooper, 1968b ; Osgood, 1909 ) and their inclusion under P. aztecus deserves further scrutiny (e.g., see Smith et al., 1989 ; Sullivan and Kilpatrick, 1991). Systematic relationships examined by Bradley and Schmidly (1987) , Smith (1990), and Sullivan and Kilpatrick (1991). Segregated together with P. spicilegus and P. winkelmanni as the aztecus species group by Carleton (1989).
Peromyscus Gloger, 1841 . Gemein Hand.-Hilfsbuch. Nat., 1:95 . TYPE SPECIES: Peromyscus arboreus Gloger, 1841 (= Mus leucopus Rafinesque, 1818 ). SYNONYMS: Haplomylomys , Sitomys , Vesperimus , Trinodontomys . COMMENTS: The Drosophila of North American mammalogy, the alpha-level classification of the genus has been revised three times ( Osgood, 1909 ; Hooper, 1968b ; Carleton, 1989) and its biology and evolution have been twice monographed ( King, 1968 ; Kirkland and Layne, 1989 ). Multispecies surveys have broadly sampled the morphology of the genus ( Carleton, 1973 , 1980 ; Hooper, 1957 , 1958 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964b ; Linzey and Layne, 1969 , 1974 ), its karyology ( Robbins and Baker, 1981 ; L. W. Robbins et al., 1983; Rogers et al., 1984; Stangl and Baker, 1984b ), biochemical variation ( Avise et al., 1974a , b, 1979; Brownell, 1983; Fuller et al., 1984 ; J. C. Patton et al., 1981; Rogers and Engstrom, 1992 ; Schmidly et al., 1985 ; Zimmerman et al., 1978 ), and geographical ecology ( Glazier, 1980 ). Major subdivisions of Peromyscus have received added revisionary attention, especially the eremicus ( Avise et al., 1974b ; Lawlor, 1971a , b), maniculatus ( Allard et al., 1987 ; Gunn and Greenbaum, 1986 ), boylii ( Avise et al., 1974a ; Bradley and Schmidly, 1987 ; Bradley et al„ 1989; Carleton, 1977 , 1979; Schmidly, 1973a ; Schmidly et al., 1988 ; Smith, 1990), truei ( Janecek, 1990 ; Modi and Lee, 1984 ; Schmidly, 1973b ; Zimmerman et al., 1975 ), and mexicanus ( Huckaby, 1980 ; Musser, 1971a ; Rogers and Engstrom, 1992 ; Smith et al., 1986 ) species groups. Greater emphasis on phylogenetic systematics has altered Osgood's (1909) original generic scope. Baiomys and Ochrotomys have been removed and ranked as separate genera ( Carleton, 1980 ; Hooper, 1958 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964b ). Taxa defined as subgenera by Hooper (1968b — Habromys , Isthmomys , Megadontomys , Osgoodomys , and Podomys ) have been considered distinct genera by Carleton (1980) but not others (Rogers, 1983; Stangl and Baker, 1984b ; Yates et al., 1979 ). Expansion of the generic limits of Hooper (1968b) has been advocated to encompass Neotomodon ( Stangl and Baker, 1984b ; Yates et al., 1979 ) and perhaps Onychomys ( Stangl and Baker, 1984b ). Nomenclatural resolution of these alternative proposals awaits further study. Haplomylomys has been used as a subgenus to contain the californicus and eremicus species groups, all others being assigned to the subgenus Peromyscus; Carleton (1989) did not employ subgeneric divisions.
Peromyscus boylii (Baird, 1855) . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 7:335 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , California , Eldorado Co., Middle Fork of American River, near Auburn . DISTRIBUTION: California to westernmost Oklahoma , USA , south to Queretaro and W Hidalgo , Mexico . SYNONYMS: gaurus , glasselli, major , metallicola , parasiticus , pinalis, robustus , rowleyi , utahensis. COMMENTS: Many taxa previously arrayed as subspecies by Osgood (1909) or Hall (1981) have been elevated to species, including P. attwateri (see Schmidly, 1973«), P. aztecus (see Alvarez, 1961 ; Carleton, 1979; Hooper, 1968b ), P. levipes (see Schmidly et al., 1988 ), P. madrensis (see Carleton, 1977 ; Carleton et al., 1982 ), P. simulus (see Carleton, 1977 ), and P. spicilegus (see Carleton, 1977 ). Others have been realigned with other species— cordillerae and evides under P. aztecus (Carleton, 1979) ; ambiguus, baetae, and sacarensis under P. levipes (Carleton, 1979; Schmidly et al., 1988 ); and penicillatus under P. difficilis ( Diersing, 1976 ) . Chromosomal variation of P. boylii and its kin investigated by Houseal et al. (1987) , Lee et al. (1972) , and Schmidly and Schroeter (1974) ; biochemical variation by Avise et al. (1974«), Kilpatrick and Zimmerman (1975) , Rennert and Kilpatrick (1986 , 1987 ); morphological variation by Bradley and Schmidly (1987) , Carleton (1977) , and Schmidly et al. (1988) .

Oryzomys subflavus (Wagner, 1842) . Arch. Naturgesh., 8(1):362 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , probably Lagoa Santa . DISTRIBUTION: E Brazil . SYNONYMS: laticeps (of Winge, 1887 ). COMMENTS: Related to, and possibly conspecific with, populations in Paraguay and Argentina usually identified as O. buccinatus (see remarks therein). Hershkovitz (1960) attributed catherinae Thomas , and rex Thomas , as synonyms of O. subflavus-, however, both are forms of Oecomys (which see). The supposed distribution of O. subflavus in the Guianas (e.g., Honacki et al., 1982 ) issued from this erroneus allocation of names (e.g., not recorded by Husson, 1978 ).

DISTRIBUTION: Cloud forest elevations from S Oaxaca and Chiapas , Mexico , through Guatemala , Honduras , and El Salvador , to NC Nicaragua . SYNONYMS: hylocetes . COMMENTS: Described as a subspecies of O. chapmani (Merriam, 1901) and later retained as a subspecies of O. alfaroi ( Goldman, 1918 ; Hall and Kelson, 1959 ). In our revision (in prep.) of the alfaroi complex we view the divergence of chapmani and saturatior , whose ranges are separated by the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as sister species.

SYNONYMS: carrikeri , magdalenae , médius , mollipilosus , panamensis , sylvaticus , villosus . COMMENTS: Considered a junior synonym of O. capito ( Hershkovitz, 1960 ) , an opinion that led to its arrangement as a subspecies thereof ( Hall, 1981 ; Handley, 1966a ). Species status reasserted by Gardner (1983a) ; morphological variation, distributional limits, and synonymy clarified by Musser and Williams (1985) .

SYNONYMS: affinis , australis , brevirostris , connectens , fumeus , guatemalae , phaeus . COMMENTS: Distribution and geographic variation examined by Lawlor (1969) , who retained australis and connectens as subspecies. See Lawlor (1982 , Mammalian Species, 181).
Oxymycterus angularis Thomas, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:237 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Pernambuco , Säo Lourenco, 30 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Brazil .
Oxymycterus delator Thomas, 1903 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 11:489 . TYPE LOCALITY: Paraguay , Paraguari Dept., Sapucai . DISTRIBUTION: E Paraguay .
Oxymycterus akodontius Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 8:615 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Jujuy Prov. , Higuerilla, 20 km E Tilcara, 2000 m . DISTRIBUTION: NW Argentina . COMMENTS: Perhaps conspecific with O. paramensis according to Cabrera (1961) and Vitullo et al. (1986) .
Osgoodomys banderanus (J. A. Allen, 1897) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:51 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Nayarit , Valle de Banderas . DISTRIBUTION: Coastal plain of S Nayarit to S Guerrero , interior of Michoacan and Guerrero along the basin of the Rio Balsas, Mexico . SYNONYMS: vicinior. COMMENTS: The forms angelensis, coatlanensis, and sloeops have been mistaken as subspecies of O. banderanus and were reassigned to Peromyscus mexicanus by Musser (1969a) .
Oxymycterus Waterhouse, 1837 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:21 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus nasutus Waterhouse, 1837 . COMMENTS: Akodontine. Specific taxonomy needs full revision; nominal species here recognized follow Cabrera (1961), Reig's (1987) provisional tally of valid forms, and Hinojosa et al. (1987) . Although initial studies of electromorphic variation support the monophyly of Oxymycterus and its placement as an akodont ( Hinojosa et al., 1987 ; Patton et al., 1989), cladistic relationship with Abrothrix, Microxus , and certain Akodon needs further exploration. Studies addressing morphological definition of Oxymycterus include Carleton (1973) , Hooper and Musser (1964a) , Hinojosa et al. (1987) , Vorontsov (1967) , and Voss and Linzey (1981) . Diploid number of species thus far karyotyped have proven to be identical ( Vitullo et al., 1986 ).
Otonyctomys Anthony, 1932 . Am. Mus. Novit., 586:1 . TYPE SPECIES: Otonyctomys hatti Anthony, 1932 . COMMENTS: Middle American endemic, presumably the sister-taxon of Nyctomys (e.g., see Hooper and Musser, 1964a ), but systematic biology poorly known.
Ototylomys Merriam, 1901 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 3:561 . TYPE SPECIES: Ototylomys phyllotis Merriam, 1901 . COMMENTS: Closedly related to Tylomys ( Carleton, 1980 ; Hooper, 1960 ; Hooper and Musser, 19646; Lawlor, 1969 ). Tribal-level assignment unresolved—viewed as a member of neotomines ( sensu Hooper and Musser , 19646) or of an archaic clade that originated prior to differentiation of other neotomine-peromyscines ( Carleton, 1980 ).
Phyllotis xanthopygus (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:28 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Santa Cruz Prov., coast of Santa Cruz . DISTRIBUTION: NW Argentina ( Catamarca ) and C Chile ( Atacama ), south along both flanks of Andes to Santa Cruz Prov., Argentina , and adjacent Magallanes Prov. , Chile . SYNONYMS: oreigenus , vaccarum, wolffhuegeli . COMMENTS: Viewed as a geographic race of P. darwini by Pearson (1958) and Hershkovitz (1962) . Morphometric, electrophoretic, and karyotypic differentiation support the specific distinction of P. xanthopygus ( Spotorno and Walker, 1983 ; Walker et al., 1984 ).
Pseudoryzomys simplex (Winge, 1887) . E Museo Lundii, 1 (3):11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , near Lagoa Santa . DISTRIBUTION: NE Argentina , W Paraguay , and SE Bolivia to E Brazil (Edo. Pernambuco ). SYNONYMS: wavrini , reigi . COMMENTS: Formerly classified as Oryzomys incertae sedis (Cabrera, 1961). Lectotype designated, synonymy presented, karyotype and distribution discussed by Voss and Myers (1991) .
Podomys floridanus (Chapman, 1889) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 2:117 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Florida, Alachua Co., Gainesville . DISTRIBUTION: Peninsular Florida, USA . COMMENTS: Smith et al. (1973) noted low heterozygosity levels within populations and high genetic similarity between them. Status considered threatened by Florida agencies due to disappearance of scrub habitat (see Layne, 1990 ).
Phyllotis wolffsohni Thomas, 1902 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:131 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , Cochabamba , Tapacari, 9900 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Upper E Andean slopes in C Bolivia . COMMENTS: Hershkovitz (1962) synonymized wolffsohni as a subspecies of P. darwini , a relationship at variance with morphological and karyotypic information ( Pearson, 1958 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ).
Podoxymys roraimae Anthony, 1929 . Am. Mus. Novit., 383:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: Guyana , summit of Mount Roraima, 8600 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Guyana and probably adjacent portions of Venezuela and Brazil . COMMENTS: Known only by six specimens ( Pérez-Zapata et al., 1992 ).
Pseudoryzomys Hershkovitz, 1962 . Fieldiana Zool., 31:208 . TYPE SPECIES: Oryzomys wavrini Thomas, 1921 (= Hesperomys simplex Winge, 1887 ). COMMENTS: Associated with phyllotines by Hershkovitz (1962) , but excluded from same by Olds and Anderson (1989) . Oryzomyine characteristics illuminated by Voss and Myers (1991) , who eschewed the "traditional phenetic practices of Neotropical muroid classification" and left the genus as Sigmodontinae incertae sedis pending phylogenetic studies of its tribal-level affinity. See Voss and Myers (1991:418) on the formal availability of the genus-group name.
Podomys Osgood, 1909 . N. Am. Fauna, 28:226 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys floridanus Chapman, 1889 . COMMENTS: Peromyscini. Named as a subgenus of Peromyscus by Osgood (1909) and maintained as such by Hooper (1968b) . Carleton (1980 , 1989) argued for generic recognition, a ranking disputed by others (Rogers et al., 1984; Stangl and Baker, 1984b ). Various morphological features suggest relationship to Neotomodon and/or Habromys ( Carleton, 1980 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964b ; Linzey and Layne, 1969 ). Accessory reproductive gland and spermatozoan morphology described by Linzey and Layne (1969 , 1974 ).
Podoxymys Anthony, 1929 . Am. Mus. Novit., 383:4 . TYPE SPECIES: Podoxymys roraimae Anthony, 1929 . COMMENTS: Akodontine. Systematics little known aside from original comparisons, report on gastric morphology by Carleton (1973) , and brief comments of Reig (1987), and new data on systematics and karyology by Pérez-Zapata et al. (1992) .
Reithrodontomys creper Bangs, 1902 . Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 39:39 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Chiriqui Prov. , Volcan de Chiriqui , 11,000 ft .

DISTRIBUTION: Transverse Volcanic Range, SE Jalisco to WC Veracruz , Mexico . SYNONYMS: colimae , orizabae , perotensis , tolucae. COMMENTS: Subgenus Reithrodontomys , megalotis species group.
Reithrodon auritus (Fischer, 1814) . Zoognosia, 3:71 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Buenos Aires Prov. , pampas south of Buenos Aires , south bank of the Rio de la Plata . DISTRIBUTION: Argentina , adjacent Chile , and Uruguay . SYNONYMS: caurinus , cuniculoides, currentium, evae, flammarum, hatcheri, marinus, obscurus , pachycephalus, pampanus, physodes, typicus . COMMENTS: The taxa associated here follow Osgood (1943) and Hershkovitz (1959a) , whose listings of probable synonyms require substantiation, as does the formal stabilization of the proper name as auritus Fischer, 1814 , versus physodes Olfers, 1818 .
Reithrodontomys brevirostris Goodwin, 1943 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1231:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: Costa Rica , Alajuela Prov. , canyons above Villa Quesada, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Allopatric populations in highlands of NC Nicaragua (see Jones and Genoways, 1970 ) and C Costa Rica . SYNONYMS: nicaraguae . COMMENTS: Subgenus Aporodon , mexicanus species group. See Jones and Baldassarre (1982 , Mammalian Species, 192).
Reithrodontomys burti Benson, 1939 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 52:147 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Sonora , Rio Sonora , Rancho de Costa Rica . DISTRIBUTION: WC Sonora to C Sinaloa , Mexico . COMMENTS: Subgenus Reithrodontomys , megalotis species group. A relict species having close affinity to R. montanus ( Hooper, 1952 ) .
Punomys lemminus Osgood, 1943 . J. Mammal., 24:369 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., San Antonio de Esquilache, 4500 m . DISTRIBUTION: Altipiano of S Peru .
Punomys Osgood, 1943 . J. Mammal., 24:369 . TYPE SPECIES: Punomys lemminus Osgood, 1943 . COMMENTS: Generic-level affinities uncertain ( Osgood, 1943 ; Reig, 1980, 1984), although formally assigned to Tribe Phyllotini by Vorontsov (1959) and Olds and Anderson (1989) .
Reithrodon Waterhouse, 1837 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:29 . TYPE SPECIES: Reithrodon typicus Waterhouse, 1838 (= Mus auritus Fischer, 1814 ). COMMENTS: Arranged by Hershkovitz (1955a) with sigmodont rodents; other evidence points to its kinship with phyllotines ( Olds and Anderson, 1989 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ).
Reithrodontomys Giglioli, 1874 . Bull. Soc. Geogr. Ital., Roma, 11:326 . TYPE SPECIES: Reithrodon megalotis Baird, 1858 . SYNONYMS: Aporodon, Ochetodon . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Alpha taxonomy revised by Allen (1895a) , Howell (1914) , and Hooper (1952) , the last of whom framed the currently-used subgeneric division and species groupings. Distributions and species limits of Latin American harvest mice, especially those of the subgenus Aporodon , require renewed systematic attention. Generic relationships investigated by Carleton (1980) , Hooper and Musser (1964a) , and J. C. Patton et al. (1981). For comparative studies of morphology, see Arata (1964) , Carleton (1973 , 1980 ), and Hooper (1952 , 1959 ); of karyology, see Carleton and Myers (1979) , Engstrom et al. (1981), Hood et al. (1984), and Robbins and Baker (1980) ; of genic variation, see Nelson et al. (1984) . A key to the species is found in Spencer and Cameron (1982) .
Phyllotis bonaeriensis Crespo, 1964 . Neotropica, 10:99 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Buenos Aires Prov. , Sierra de la Ventana . DISTRIBUTION: Buenos Aires Prov. , Argentina . COMMENTS: Formerly included in P. darwini (see Reig, 1978 ).
Phyllotis andium Thomas, 1912 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 10:409 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Canar Prov. , Canar , 8500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: E and W Andean slopes from C Ecuador ( Tungurahua ) to C Peru ( Lima ). SYNONYMS: fruticicolus , melanius , stenops, tamborum .
Peromyscus yucatanicus J. A. Allen and Chapman, 1897 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:8 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Yucatan , Chichen-Itza . DISTRIBUTION: N Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico . SYNONYMS: badius . COMMENTS: Huckaby (1980) followed Lawlor (1965) in treating P. yucatanicus as monotypic; Hall (1981) accepted Osgood's (1909) subspecific arrangement. The notion (e.g., Lawlor, 1965 ; Hooper, 1968b ) that P. yucatanicus is most closely related to P. mexicanus has not received support ( Carleton, 1973 ; Huckaby, 1980 ). See Young and Jones (1983 , Mammalian Species, 196). P. mexicanus species group.
Peromyscus winkelmanni Carleton, 1977 . Occas. Pap. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan , 675:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Michoacan , 6.3 mi (by road) WSW Dos Aguas, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Isolated localities in the Sierra de Coalcoman, Michoacan , and in Guerrero , Mexico (after Sullivan et al., 1991). COMMENTS: Karyotype reported by Smith et al. (1989) ; relationships evaluated by Bradley and Schmidly (1987) and Sullivan et al. (1991). Removed to aztecus species group by Carleton (1989).
Phyllotis amicus Thomas, 1900 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 5:355 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Cajamarca Dept., Tolon, 100 m . DISTRIBUTION: Coast and lower Pacific slopes of W Peru (Depts. Lambayeque to Ayacucho ). SYNONYMS: maritimus , montanus .

DISTRIBUTION: Middle to high elevation cloud forest in mountains of NC Chiapas , Mexico . SYNONYMS: cristobalensis. COMMENTS: Distribution and morphological variation reviewed by Huckaby (1980) . Relationship and taxonomic status with respect to P. guatemalensis and P. grandis unresolved. P. mexicanus species group.
Phaenomys Thomas, 1917 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 20: 196 . TYPE SPECIES: Oryzomys ferrugineus Thomas, 1894 . COMMENTS: Thomasomyine. Rare in collections; knowledge of taxonomy and distribution minimal.
Phyllotis Waterhouse, 1837 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:27 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus darwini Waterhouse, 1837 . SYNONYMS: Paralomys . COMMENTS: Phyllotine. Full generic revisions by Pearson (1958) and Hershkovitz (1962) . Pearson (1958) utilized Auliscomys , Graomys , and Loxodontomys as subgenera, whereas Hershkovitz (1962) placed all three, plus Paralomys , in complete synonymy—see accounts of Auliscomys and Graomys for their reinstatement as genera. New karyotypic and distributional data bearing on species status and relationships provided by Pearson (1972) , Spotorno (1976) , and Pearson and Patton (1976) .
Phyllotis osgoodi Mann, 1945 . Biologica, 2:81 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Tarapaca Prov. , Parinacota . DISTRIBUTION: Altipiano of NE Chile . COMMENTS: Relegated to synonymy under P. darwini ( Hershkovitz, 1962 ; Pearson, 1958 ) but considerable evidence supports its validity as a species ( Spotorno, 1976 ; Spotorno and Walker, 1979 , 1983 ).
Phyllotis magister Thomas, 1912 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 10:406 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Arequipa Dept., Arequipa , 2300 m . DISTRIBUTION: Upper Pacific slopes of Andes from C Peru to N Chile . COMMENTS: Hershkovitz (1962) treated magister as a race of P. darwini , a position inconsistent with records of sympatry ( Pearson, 1958 ) and karyotypic differences ( Pearson, 1972 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ). Pearson (1958) arranged definitus as a subspecies of P. magister but later (1972) supported its specific status.
Phyllotis haggardi Thomas, 1908 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 2:270 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Pichincha Prov. , Mount Pichincha , above Quito, 3400-4000 m . DISTRIBUTION: Andes of C Ecuador . SYNONYMS: elegantulus , fuscus .
Phyllotis osilae J. A. Allen, 1901 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:44 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., Osila ( Pearson, 1958:426 , considered the place-name equivalent to Asillo, 17 mi ENE Ayaviri, 13,000 ft ) . DISTRIBUTION: Upper Andean slopes on Atlantic drainage, from SC Peru ( Cuzco ), through WC Bolivia , to N Argentina ( Catamarca ). SYNONYMS: lutescens , nogalaris , phaeus , tucumanus . COMMENTS: All-acrocentric karyotype (2n=68) interpreted as ancestral state of the genus ( Pearson and Patton, 1976 ).
Phyllotis caprinus Pearson, 1958 . Univ. California Pubi. Zool., 56:435 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Jujuy Prov. , Tilcara, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Upper slopes of E Andes from S Bolivia to northernmost Argentina . COMMENTS: Demoted to a subspecies of P. darwini by Hershkovitz (1962) , but distributional and morphological evidence substantiates the specific recognition of P. caprinus ( Pearson, 1958 ) .
Phyllotis darwini (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:28 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Coquimbo Prov. , Coquimbo .

SYNONYMS: abrocodon , arenarius , boedeckeri , campestris , capito , chilensis, dichrous , fulvescens , glirinus , griseoflavus (of Philippi, 1900 ), illapelinus , lanatus , limatus , megalotis , melanotis , melanotus , mollis , platytarsus , posticalis, ricarulus, rupestris , segethi . COMMENTS: See accounts of P. bonaeriensis , P. caprinus , P. definitus , P. magister , P. osgoodi , P. wolffsohni , and P. xanthopygus , previously arrayed as subspecies of P. darwini by Pearson (1958) and /or Hershkovitz (1962) , for references addressing their specific status. The complexity of populations comprising this species urges still further revisionary attention.
Phyllotis gerbillus Thomas, 1900 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 5:151 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Piura Dept., Piura . DISTRIBUTION: Sechura Desert of NW Peru . COMMENTS: Type species of Paralomys , a genus named by Thomas (1926a) ; included within Phyllotis by Osgood (1947) , a position supported by its derived karyotype ( Pearson and Patton, 1976 ). The relationship of gerbillus to other Phyllotis deserves reconsideration.
Phyllotis definitus Osgood, 1915 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:189 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Ancash Dept., Macate, 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Andes of Ancash , Peru . COMMENTS: Included in P. magister by Pearson (1958) and in P. darwini by Hershkovitz (1962) but distinctive karyotype is unlike either of those species (see Pearson, 1972 ).
Peromyscus sejugis Burt, 1932 . Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 7:171 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Baja California Sur, Santa Cruz Island, 25°17'N , 110°43'W . DISTRIBUTION: Santa Cruz and San Diego islands, S Gulf of California, Mexico . COMMENTS: Highly differentiated morphologically and genetically from mainland P. maniculatus ( Avise et al., 1974b , 1979; Burt, 1932 ), though probably derived from a maniculatus-like ancestor ( Lawlor, 1983 ). P. maniculatus species group.
Peromyscus pembertoni Burt, 1932 . Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 7:176 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Sonora , San Pedro Nolasco Island, 27°58'N , 111°24'W .

DISTRIBUTION: Coastal lowlands of Jalisco and Colima , along Rio Balsas to interior Michocan and northernmost Guerrero , Mexico . SYNONYMS: chrysopus . COMMENTS: Placed with P. melanophrys group by Hooper (1968b) , an association supported by electrophoretic data ( Schmidly et al., 1985 ).
Peromyscus pectoralis Osgood, 1904 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 17:59 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Queretaro , Jalpan . DISTRIBUTION: SE New Mexico and C Texas , USA , south to N Jalisco and Hidalgo , Mexico . SYNONYMS: collinus , eremicoides, laceianus. COMMENTS: Revised by Schmidly (1972) , who recognized three subspecies which correspond to patterns of genetic differentiation ( Kilpatrick and Zimmerman, 1976 ). Consanguinity of included populations nevertheless suspect (see Avise et al., 1974a ). See Schmidly (1974b , Mammalian Species, 49). P. boylii species group.

Relationships assessed by Avise et al. (1979) , Rogers et al. (1984), and Stangl and Baker (1984b) . P. maniculatus species group.
Peromyscus pseudocrinitus Burt, 1932 . Trans. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist., 7:173 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Baja California Sur, Coronados Island, 26°06'N , 111°18'W . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Tentatively allocated to crinitus species group by Hooper (1968b) ; affinities to P. eremicus asserted by Lawlor (1971a) and believed derived therefrom ( Lawlor, 1983 ). P. eremicus species group.
Peromyscus polius Osgood, 1904 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 17:61 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Chihuahua , Colonia Garcia . DISTRIBUTION: WC Chihuahua , Mexico . COMMENTS: Species-group affiliation enigmatic: initially placed in truei group ( Osgood, 1909 ) but provisionally reassigned to boylii group ( Hoffmeister, 1951 ). Genetic distance data weakly support the latter association ( Kilpatrick and Zimmerman, 1975 ; Schmidly et al., 1985 ); also see Bradley and Schmidly (1987) . P. boylii species group.
Peromyscus spicilegus J. A. Allen, 1897 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:50 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Jalisco , Mascota, Mineral San Sebastian . DISTRIBUTION: Intermediate elevations of Sierra Madre Occidental from S Sinaloa and SW Durango to WC Michoacan , Mexico . COMMENTS: Arranged as a subpecies of P. boylii by Osgood (1909 ; and Hall, 1981 ). Morphological, chromosomal, and distributional data require its recognition as a species having closer affinity to P. aztecus and its allies (see Bradley and Schmidly, 1987 ; Carleton, 1977 , 1979; Carleton et al., 1982 ; Hooper, 19686). Includes populations in Michoacan once identified as evides (see Carleton, 1977 ; Smith et al., 1989 ). Variation with altitude investigated by Sanchez-Cordero and Villa-Ramirez (1988) . P. aztecus species group.
Peromyscus stirtoni Dickey, 1928 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 41:5 . TYPE LOCALITY: El Salvador , La Union, Rio Goascoran, 13 deg. 30' N, 100 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Intermittently found in dry to semiarid lowlands from SE Guatemala , through El Salvador and Honduras , to NC Nicaragua . COMMENTS: Although Hooper (19686) questioned the specific recognition of P. stirtoni , others have substantiated its distinctive morphology and habitat ( Huckaby, 1980 ; Jones and Yates, 1983 ). Late Holocene remains from Guanacaste Prov. , Costa Rica , suggest a recent range contraction of this species (see Woodman, 1988 ). See Jones (1990, Mammalian Species, 361). Tentatively retained in the mexicanus species group (Carleton, 1989).
Peromyscus Stephani Townsend, 1912 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 31:126 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Sonora , San Esteban Island, 28°34'N , 113°21 'W . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Isla San Esteban. COMMENTS: Lawlor (19716) demonstrated the 6oy/ii-like traits of P. stephani , which was previously classified in the subgenus Haplomylomys (Hooper, 19686). Electrophoretic investigations support its specific status ( Avise et al., 1974a , b). P. boylii species group.
Peromyscus sitkensis Merriam, 1897 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 11:223 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Alaska , Baranof Island, Sitka . DISTRIBUTION: Outer islands of Alexander Archipelago, off Alaskan panhandle, USA . SYNONYMS: oceanicus. COMMENTS: Banded karyotypes reported by Pengilly et al. (1983) . Insular forms off southern British Columbia referred to sitkensis by Thomas (1973) but identified as P. oreas by Gunn and Greenbaum (1986) . These studies underscore the need to refine relationships among P. sitkensis , P. oreas , and certain forms of P. maniculatus . P. maniculatus species group.
Peromyscus simulus Osgood, 1904 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 17:64 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Nayarit , San Blas . DISTRIBUTION: Coastal plain of Nayarit and S Sinaloa , Mexico . COMMENTS: Previously classified as a geographic race of P. boylii ( Osgood, 1909 ; also see Hall, 1981 ); elevated to species by Carleton (1977) . Relationships addressed by Bradley and Schmidly (1987) and Carleton et al. (1982) . P. boylii species group.

DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Proposed derivation from a maniculatus-like ancestor ( Lawlor, 1983 ) needs critical reexamination; association with maniculatus species group judged tenuous by Carleton (1989; also see Burt, 1934 ).
Peromyscus truei (Shufeldt, 1885) . Proc. U. S. Natl. Mus., 8:407 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , New Mexico , McKinley Co., Fort Wingate .

DISTRIBUTION: In Mexico—along the Atlantic coast from S San Luis Potosi to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and along the Pacific coast, from the Guerrero-Oaxaca border to C Chiapas; upper foothills and middle-elevation mountains in Guatemala , through El Salvador , Honduras , and Nicaragua , to upper highlands in Costa Rica and W Panama ( Chiriqui region ). SYNONYMS: angelensis, azulensis, cacabatus , coatlanensis, Hesperus, nicaraguae , nudipes , orientalis , orizabae , philombrius, salvadorensis, sloeops, teapensis , tehuantepecus , totontepecus, tropicalis . COMMENTS: Geographic range, variation, and taxonomic synonymy summarized by Huckaby (1980) . Includes forms formerly viewed as members of Osgoodomys banderanus (angelensis, coatlanensis, and sloeops—see Musser, 1969«), P. guatemalensis ( tropicalis — see Musser, 1969«), and P. megalops (azulensis— see Huckaby, 1980 ). Although these taxa were erroneously associated by their original describers, the conspecific status of populations now arranged under P. mexicanus direly needs investigation. In particular, southern populations identified as nudipes , arranged as a synonym by Huckaby (1980) and Carleton (1989), have been considered a distinct species ( Osgood, 1909 ; Hooper, 1968b ) and deserve additional scrutiny. Euchromatic banding patterns identical in P. mexicanus and related species so far examined ( Smith et al., 1986 ). See account of P. gymnotis , which had been arranged as a race of P. mexicanus .

DISTRIBUTION: SW British Columbia, including Vancouver Island and neighboring islands, Canada, and W Washington, USA. SYNONYMS: interdictus, isolatus. COMMENTS: Maintained as a subspecies of P. maniculatus by Osgood (1909) and Hooper (1968b) . Sheppe (1961) considered oreas a distinct species, a conclusion ratified by recent taxonomic research ( Allard et al. 1987 ; Allard and Greenbaum, 1988 ; Calhoun and Greenbaum, 1991 ; Gunn and Greenbaum, 1986 ; Sullivan et al., 1990 ).

Oecomys Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:444 . TYPE SPECIES: Rhipidomys benevolens Thomas, 1901 (= Hesperomys bicolor Tomes, 1860 ). COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. Diagnosed as a subgenus of Oryzomys to segregate arboreal, pencil-tailed sigmodontines with a long palate from Rhipidomys , under which many of the species included here were first described. Thereafter treated alternatively as a subgenus of Oryzomys ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Goldman, 1918 ) or as full genus ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Thomas, 1917c ) until Hershkovitz's (1960) revision stabilized its ranking as a subgenus (e.g., Cabrera, 1961; Hall, 1981 ). Systematists have recently acknowledged the morphological and karyotypic distinctiveness of Oecomys at the generic level ( Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Reig, 1984 , 1986), but this recognition as yet lacks convincing substantiation from a phylogenetic perspective. Revised by Hershkovitz (1960) , who consolidated some 25 species (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ) into the two species bicolor and concolor . Although this gross underestimation of the species diversity within Oecomys has been intimated by other authors (e.g., Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Reig, 1986 ), it has yet to be documented within a taxonomic revision. The species identified here issue from our revision in progress; we are confident that all of these will stand as valid yet some, such as O. trinitatis , are undoubtedly composites even now.
Nyctomys Saussure, 1860 . Rev. Mag. Zool. Paris, ser. 2, 12:106 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys sumichrasti Saussure, 1860 . COMMENTS: Middle American endemic of enigmatic phyletic position. Placed with thomasomyine group of South American sigmodontines by Hershkovitz (1944 , 1962 ); others have disputed the association with thomasomyines, instead suggesting distant kinship to neotomine-peromyscines or a cladistic origin prior to both North and South American sigmodontines ( Arata, 1964 ; Carleton, 1980 ; Haiduk et al., 1988 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964a ; Voss and Linzey, 1981 ).
Ochrotomys Osgood, 1909 . N. Am. Fauna, 28:222 . TYPE SPECIES: Arvicola nuttalli Harlan, 1832 . COMMENTS: Although diagnosed as a subgenus of Peromyscus , the distant kinship and generic segregation of Ochrotomys have been repeatedly sustained ( Blair, 1942 ; Carleton, 1980 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964b ; Patton and Hsu, 1967 ). A peromyscine, but this conventional placement has been questioned (see Engstrom and Bickham, 1982 ; Carleton, 1989:115).

DISTRIBUTION: Santa Cruz , Baltra (= South Seymour), and Fernandina (= Narborough) islands. SYNONYMS: narboroughi . COMMENTS: Patton and Hafner (1983:539) recommended that indefessus , narboroughi , and swarthi are "best considered races of a single species, which differ primarily in pelage color." Their analyses sustain this conclusion with regard to indefessus and narboroughi but not the craniodental differentiation of N. swarthi . N. i. indefessus is probably extinct, none documented since 1934 (see Patton and Hafner, 1983 ). Populations of N. i. narboroughi on Fernandina Island, which lacks commensal Rattus and Mus , appear stable (see Patton and Hafner, 1983 ).

Nesoryzomys Heller, 1904 . Proc. California Acad. Sci., 3:241 . TYPE SPECIES: Nesoryzomys narboroughi Heller, 1904 (= Oryzomys indefessus Thomas, 1899 ). COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. Realigned as a subgenus of Oryzomys by Ellerman (1941) , following the comments of Goldman (1918) . Morphological, genic, and karyological information, however, sustains the generic separation of Nesoryzomys ( Beaufort, 1963 ; Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Patton and Hafner, 1983 ) and intimates that the group is an old Galapagos immigrant, originating ca. 3-3.5 mya (see Patton and Hafner, 1983 ).
Neotomys Thomas, 1894 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:346 . TYPE SPECIES: Neotomys ebriosus Thomas, 1894 . COMMENTS: Revised by Sanborn (1947a) ; distribution augmented by Pine et al. (1979) . Although grouped with sigmodont rodents by Hershkovitz (1955a) , other studies have convincingly linked the genus with phyllotines ( Olds and Anderson, 1989 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ).
Neotomodon Merriam, 1898 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 12:127 . TYPE SPECIES: Neotomodon alstoni Merriam, 1898 . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Conventionally ranked as a genus, later judged closely related to Peromyscus sensu lato ( Hooper and Musser, 1964b ). Synonymy as a subgenus of Peromyscus advocated by Yates et al. (1979) and J. C. Patton et al. (1981), whereas Carleton (1980 , 1989) retained Neotomodon as a genus. Various kinds of evidence suggest the phyletic association of Neotomodon, Podomys, and perhaps Habromys ( Carleton, 1980 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964b ; Linzey and Layne, 1969 ; J. C. Patton et al., 1981; Stangl and Baker, 1984b ).

DISTRIBUTION: Known only from San Salvador (= James, Santiago) Island . COMMENTS: Status viewed as a insular race of N. indefessus by Patton and Hafner (1983) , but Orr (1938) underscored the trenchant diagnostic traits that separate N. swarthi from both N. indefessus and narboroughi . Remnant populations thought to exist as of 1965 (see Peterson, 1966b ); recent efforts have uncovered only Rattus and Mus (see Patton and Hafner, 1983 ).

COMMENTS: Subgenus Teonoma . Independent evidence for sister-species relationship to N. fuscipes ( Carleton, 1980 ; Koop et al., 1985 ) supports synonymy of Homodontomys under subgenus Teonoma , not subgenus Neotoma as enacted by Burt and Barkalow (1942) .

COMMENTS: Hershkovitz (1944) arrayed most nominal taxa of water rats as subspecies of N. squamipes , a view maintained by Cabrera (1961). Gardner and Patton (1976) intimated the mixed composition of squamipes ; Reig (in Honacki et al., 1982 ; 1986) has offered enumerations of valid species and probable synonymies. Fullscale generic revision warranted. See Ernest (1986 , Mammalian Species, 265).

Hybridization suspected with N. micropus in Colorado ( Finley, 1958 ) and apparent intergradation of the two in Coahuila (Anderson, 19696). Closely related to N. floridana and N. micropus ( Birney, 1976 ) , the three considered semispecies by Zimmerman and Nejtek (1977) . See Macêdo and Mares (1988 , Mammalian Species, 310).
Neotoma Say and Ord, 1825 . J. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 4:345 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus floridana Ord, 1818 . SYNONYMS: Homodontomys , Teanopus , Teonoma . COMMENTS: Neotomine. Revised by Goldman (1910) , then including only Homodontomys, Teonoma , and the nominate subgenus. Burt and Barkalow (1942) established current subgeneric framework, also relegating Hodomys and Teanopus to subgenera. See Birney (1976) and Mascarello (1978) for modifications of species-group associations since Goldman (1910) . Phylogenetic relationships of the genus considered by Hooper and Musser (1964a) and Carleton (1980) , who reinstated Hodomys as a genus (see above account); interspecific relationships evaluated by Carleton (1980) and Koop et al.

Oryzomys nelsoni Merriam, 1898 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 12:15 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Nayarit , Maria Madre Island . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Extinct? COMMENTS: Known only by 4 specimens of the type series. Allied to O. couesi , under which Hershkovitz (1971) listed it as a subspecies. Others ( Goldman, 1918 ; Hall, 1981 ) have maintained it as a species in view of its unique differentiation from mainland O. palustris . Presumed to be extinct (see Wilson, 1991).
Oryzomys lamia Thomas, 1901 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 8:528 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , along Rio Jordao, a small tributary of the Rio Paranaiba, 700- 900 m .

Oryzomys keaysi J. A. Allen, 1900 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 13:225 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., valley of upper Rio Inambari, Inca Mines , 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Montane rainforest of E Peruvian Andes. COMMENTS: A subspecies of O. albigularis sensu Cabrera (1961) . Genetically divergent from O. albigularis and O. levipes ; contiguously allopatric to the latter (see Patton et al., 1990).
Oryzomys levipes Thomas, 1902 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:129 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., Limbane, 2200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Cloud forest of SE Peru to WC Bolivia . COMMENTS: Synonymized under O. albigularis keaysi by Cabrera (1961). Genetically divergent from and altitudinally parapatric to O. keaysi in Peru (see Patton et al., 1990).
Oryzomys melanotis Thomas, 1893 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 11:404 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Jalisco , Mineral San Sebastian . DISTRIBUTION: Low to intermediate elevations of W Mexico , from S Sinaloa to SW Oaxaca . SYNONYMS: colimensis. COMMENTS: Revised by Goldman (1918) , who recognized melanotis and rostratus as separate species within a melanotis species group. Hooper (1953) viewed the geographic complementarity of the two as a subspecific pattern, and so recognized by Hall and Kelson (1959) and Hall (1981) . Engstrom (1984) returned rostratus to a separate species based on a robust variety of data interpreted within a zoogeographic context.
Oryzomys kelloggi Avila-Pires, 1959 . Atas Soc. Biol. Rio de Janiero, 3(4):2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Alem Paraiba . DISTRIBUTION: SE Brazil . COMMENTS: Status with regard to O. intermedius needs investigation.
Oryzomys macconnelli Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:186 . TYPE LOCALITY: Guyana , Demerara Dist., Rio Supinaam, a tributary of the Lower Essequibo . DISTRIBUTION: Lowlands of SC Colombia , E Ecuador and Peru , east to S Venezuela , Guianas, and N Brazil . SYNONYMS: incertus (of J. A. Allen, 1913 ), mureliae. COMMENTS: Included in O. capito by Hershkovitz (1960) but retained as species by Cabrera (1961). Morphological and karyotypic basis for species recognition reinforced by Pine (1973b) , Gardner and Patton (1976) , and Husson (1978) (see comments under O. intermedius ).
Oryzomys legatus Thomas, 1925 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 15:577 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , Tarija Dept., Carapari, 1000 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Andean slopes of SC Bolivia and NW Argentina . COMMENTS: Considered conspecific with O. capito by Hershkovitz (1960) and Cabrera (1961). Gardner and Patton (1976) viewed legatus as a probable synonym of O. nitidus , to which it appears closely related. Retained here as a species following the study of Massoia (1975 ; also Mares et al., 1989b ) and pending determination of its status with regard to O. nitidus and O. intermedius (see comments therein).
Oryzomys rostratus Merriam, 1901 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 3:293 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Puebla , Metlaltoyuca . DISTRIBUTION: Deciduous and evergreen tropical forests from central Tamaulipas to Oaxaca and Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico , through Guatemala , El Salvador , and Honduras , to S Nicaragua . SYNONYMS: carrorum, megadon, salvadorensis, yucatanensis . COMMENTS: Considered a subspecies of O. melanotis ( Hall, 1981 ; Hooper, 1953 ). Engstrom (1984) effectively argued the specific distinctiveness of O. rostratus (also see account of O. melanotis ). Distributional records in Nicaragua reviewed, as O. melanotis megadon , by Jones and Engstrom (1986) . Homogeneity of populations assigned to O. rostratus warrants additional study.
Oryzomys nitidus (Thomas, 1884) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1884:452 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Junin Dept., valley of Rio Tulumayo, 10 km S San Ramon, Amable Maria, 2000 ft (as located by Gardner and Patton, 1976:42 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Lowland rain forest of E Ecuador , Peru and Bolivia , and WC Brazil ( Mato Grosso ). SYNONYMS: boliviae . COMMENTS: A species formerly included in O. capito sensu Cabrera (1961) or affiliated with O. alfaroi by Hershkovitz (1966c) . Gardner and Patton (1976) provided karyotypic and morphological evidence justifying the specific distinction of O. nitidus from both and listed boliviae , intermedius , and legatus as likely synonyms (see remarks under O. intermedius ).
Oryzomys oniscus Thomas, 1904 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 13:142 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Pernambuco , Sâo Lorenzo, 50 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Brazil ( Pernambuco , Bahia ). COMMENTS: Arranged as a subspecies of O. capito by Cabrera (1961). Although closely related to O. capito , this form is specifically distinct ( Moojen, 1952 ).
Oryzomys palustris (Harlan, 1837) . Am. J. Sci., 31:385 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , New Jersey , Salem Co., "Fastland," near Salem . DISTRIBUTION: SE USA : SE Kansas to E Texas , eastwards to S New Jersey and peninsular Florida. STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered in the Lower Florida Keys (west of the Seven Mile Bridge) as O. p. natator; IUCN - Indeterminate as O. argentatus in Florida. SYNONYMS: argentatus , coloratus , natator, oryzivora, planirostris, sanibeli, texensis. COMMENTS: Formerly included couesi and related forms as subspecies (see account of O. couesi ). Geographic variation evaluated by Humphrey and Setzer (1989) , who acknowledged the nominate and one other subspecies, O. p. natator. The status of argentatus has oscillated recently: described as a species from the Florida Keys by Spitzer and Lazell (1978) ; synonymized under O. palustris natator by Humphrey and Setzer (1989) ; reinstated as species by Goodyear (1991) . Here we follow Humphrey and Setzer (1989) based on their broader geographic sampling and more robust analyses. In light of the subspecific endemism displayed among other Florida-Key mammals, the status of argentatus merits further study drawing upon genetic evidence. See Wolfe (1982 , Mammalian Species, 176).
Oryzomys ratticeps (Hensel, 1873) . Abh. König Akad. Wiss. Berlin , 1872:36 [1873]. TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Rio Grande do Sul . DISTRIBUTION: E Brazil , NE Argentina , and Paraguay . SYNONYMS: moojeni, paraganus, rex (of Winge, 1887 ), tropicius. COMMENTS: Referred to O. buccinatus by Hershkovitz (1959a) but its separate specific status is well-established ( Avila-Pires, 1960a ; Moojen, 1952 ).
Oryzomys polius Osgood, 1913 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:97 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Amazonas Dept., mountains east of Balsas, Tambo Carrizal, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: NC Peru . COMMENTS: Affinities obscure; compared to O. xantheolus by Osgood (1913) .
Oryzomys rhabdops Merriam, 1901 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 3:292 . TYPE LOCALITY: Guatemala , Quezaltenango Dept., Calel, 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Highlands of S Chiapas , Mexico , and C Guatemala . SYNONYMS: angusticeps . COMMENTS: Allocated to subspecies of O. alfaroi by Goldman (1918) ; we reinstate it as a species (revision in progress).
Oryzomys couesi (Alston, 1877) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1876:756 [1877]. TYPE LOCALITY: Guatemala , Alta Verapaz Dept., Coban . DISTRIBUTION: Extreme S Texas , USA ; Mexico , excluding NC plateau region, south through most of Central America, to NW Colombia (see Hershkovitz, 1987a ); including Jamaica and Isla Cozumel. SYNONYMS: albiventer , antillarum , apatelius, aquaticus , aztecus , azuerensis , bulleri , cozumelae , crinitus , fulgens , gatunensis , goldmani , jalapae, Iambi , mexicanus , peninsulae , peragrus, pinicola , regillus, richardsoni , richmondi , rufinus , rufus , teapensis , zygomaticus . COMMENTS: Retained as a species by Goldman (1918) until Hall (1960) considered it only subspecifically distinct from O. palustris . Benson and Gehlbach (1979) returned O. couesi to specific status based on morphological contrasts with O. p. texensis in supposed area of intergradation. Karyotype reported by Benson and Gehlbach (1979) and Haiduk et al. (1979) ; morphometric comparisons to O. palustris by Humphrey and Setzer (1989) . Following Hall's (1960) example, other insular or localized subspecies—namely, antillarum , azuerensis , cozumelae , fulgens , gatunensis , and peninsulae (see Handley, 1966a ; Hershkovitz, 1971 ; Jones and Lawlor, 1965 )—were swept under O. palustris . They are here included in O. couesi because of geographic proximity, but their placement, together with other Central American populations referred to O. couesi , should be critically reviewed.
Oryzomys capito (Olfers, 1818) . In Eschwege, J. Brasilien , Neue Bibliothek. Reisenb., 15:209 . TYPE LOCALITY: Paraguay , San Ignacio Guazu . DISTRIBUTION: S Venezuela and Guianas, Brazil and Amonzonian regions of Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia . SYNONYMS: cephalotes, goeldi, laticeps (of Lund, 1841 ), modestus , perenensis , saltator , velutinus . COMMENTS: Taxonomic understanding of this species embroiled by the infelicitous footnote of Hershkovitz (1960:544) , who suggested the synonymy of some 20 taxa under O. capito , an opinion expanded by Cabrera (1961) and followed by other authors (e.g., Handley, 1966a , 1976). The extremeness of this viewpoint was seriously challenged by the karyotypic study of Gardner and Patton (1976) ; as a result, the following forms considered synonyms by Hershkovitz (1960) and /or Cabrera (1961) are now acknowledged as distinct species or as synonyms of other species (see separate accounts): O. intermedius , O. legatus , O. macconnelli , O. nitidus , O. oniscus , rivularis (of O. bolivaris ), O. talamancae , and O. yunganus . As with other names based on Azara's (1801) characterizations, the clear fixation of this name to a species morphology and the proper usage of megacephalus Fischer, 1814 , versus capito Olfers, 1818 , should be formally established.
Oryzomys buccinatus (Olfers, 1818) . In Eschwege, J. Brasilien , Neue Bibliothek. Reisenb., 15:209 . TYPE LOCALITY: Paraguay , Caraguatay Dept., 45 km east of Asunción , Atyra . DISTRIBUTION: E Paraguay and NE Argentina . SYNONYMS: angouya (of Desmarest, 1819), anguya. COMMENTS: Level of differentiation from O. subflavus of E Brazil requires study. Hershkovitz (1959a) mistakenly included O. ratticeps within O. buccinatus , but the two species co-occur in E Paraguay (Cabrera, 1961; Myers, 1982 ). As with other names based on Azara's (1801) characterizations, the clear fixation of this name to a species morphology and the proper usage of angouya Fischer, 1814 , versus buccinatus Olfers, 1818 , should be formally established.
Oryzomys chapmani Thomas, 1898 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 1:179 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Veracruz , Jalapa, 4400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Cloud forest elevations of Cordillera Oriental ( Tamaulipas to Veracruz ), Sistema Montanosa (N Oaxaca ), and Sierra Madre del Sur (S Oaxaca and Guerrero ), Mexico . SYNONYMS: caudatus , dilutior, guerrerensis , huastecae. COMMENTS: Relegated to a subspecies of O. alfaroi by Goldman (1918) . Goodwin (1969) recognized caudatus as distinct from O. alfaroi in N Oaxaca , but, as earlier arranged by Merriam (1901), O. chapmani has priority for this Mexican species. We view O. saturatior as the vicariant relative of O. chapmani (revision in progress). Karyotype reported, as O. caudatus , by Haiduk et al. (1979) .
Oryzomys intermedius (Leche, 1886) . Zool. Jahrb., 1:693 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Rio Grande do Sul , Taquara do Mundo Novo . DISTRIBUTION: SE Brazil ( Bahia to Rio Grande do Sul ), E Paraguay , and NE Argentina (fide Massoia, 1975 ). COMMENTS: Classified as a subspecies of O. capito by Cabrera (1961) although its distinction from laticeps (= O. capito ) was earlier maintained by Moojen (1952) . Gardner and Patton (1976) perceived the closer kinship of intermedius to O. nitidus and suggested their synonymy. Oryzomys intermedius , O. legatus , O. macconnelli , and O. nitidus form a closely-related complex whose interrelationships, specific stature, and distributions deserve investigation.
Oryzomys devius Bangs, 1902 . Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 39:34 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Chiriqui Prov. , Volcan de Chiriqui , Boquete, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Highlands of Costa Rica and westernmost Panama . COMMENTS: Maintained as a species until relegated to synonymy under O. albigularis by Handley (1966a) , emulating the treatment of South American albigularis-like forms by Cabrera (1961). Gardner (1983a) , however, continued to rank devius as a species. The status of devius must be evaluated within a revisionary context of the entire albigularis complex.
Oryzomys dimidiatus (Thomas, 1905) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 15:586 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nicaragua , Zelaya Dept., Rio Escondido, 7 mi below Rama . DISTRIBUTION: SE Nicaragua . COMMENTS: Described as a species of Nectomys and included therein as incertae sedis by Hershkovitz (1944) . Later designated as the type species of Micronectomys , subgenus Oryzomys , by Hershkovitz (19486), who afterwards (1970b) acknowledged the taxon as an nomen nudum (also see Pine and Wetzel, 1975:653 ). Morphological features resemble those of the O. couesi-palustris complex ( Hershkovitz, 1970b ). Only two specimens known (see Jones and Engstrom, 1986 ).
Oryzomys galapagoensis (Waterhouse, 1839) . Zool. Voy. H. M. S. "Beagle," Mammalia, p. 66 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Galapagos Islands , Chatham Island . DISTRIBUTION: San Cristobal (= Chatham) and Sante Fe (= Barrington) islands. SYNONYMS: bauri. COMMENTS: Cabrera (1961) assigned bauri as a synonym of O. galapagoensis , an action more fully documented by Patton and Hafner (1983) . Related to Oryzomys xantheolus complex on mainland South America ( Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Patton and Hafner, 1983 ). Extirpated from San Cristobal Isl but populations (O. g. bauri) still inhabit Sante Fe Isl (see Patton and Hafner, 1983 ).
Oryzomys intectus Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 8:356 . TYPE LOCALITY: Colombia , Antioquia Dept., 8 km E Medellin, Santa Elena , 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: NC Colombia . COMMENTS: Distinctive species of uncertain affinities, variously associated with O. balneator or Melanomys ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ) , with Nectomys ( Ellerman, 1941 ) , or with subgenus Oryzomys (Cabrera, 1961) . Such a diversity of opinion begs renewed study.
Oryzomys hammondi (Thomas, 1913) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 12:570 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Pichincha Prov. , Mindo, 4213 ft . DISTRIBUTION: NW Ecuador . COMMENTS: Described as a species of Nectomys and included therein as incertae sedis by Hershkovitz (1944) . Later designated as the type species of Macruroryzomys , subgenus Oryzomys , by Hershkovitz (1948b) , who afterwards (1970b) acknowledged the taxon as a nomen nudum (also see Pine and Wetzel, 1975:653 ). Distributional limits poorly definded and affinities obscure, perhaps related to the extirpated Antillean form Megalomys ( Ray, 1962 ) .
Oryzomys gorgasi Hershkovitz, 1971 . J. Mammal., 52:700 . TYPE LOCALITY: Colombia , Antioquia Dept., basin of Rio Atrato, Loma Teguerre, just below and opposite Sautata (Choco), 1 m ; 7°54'N , 77°W . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Known only by the holotype ; related to O. couesi and O. palustris (see Hershkovitz, 1971 ).
Oryzomys Baird, 1858 . Mammalia in Repts. U.S. Expl. Surv., 8(1):458 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus palustris Harlan, 1837 . COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. A taxonomically complex and nomenclaturally confused group whose generic definition was successively broadened by Goldman (1918) , Tate (1932d , e), and Ellerman (1941) . By the time of Cabrera (1961), the genus embraced as subgenera Melanomys , Microryzomys , Nesoryzomys , Oecomys , and Oligoryzomys — an agglomeration of taxa perhaps as evolutionarily divergent from one another and from Oryzomys sensu stricto as Neacomys and Nectomys , forms traditionally accorded generic status (see Carleton and Musser, 1989:52 ). Others have recognized all of these or various ones as genera (e.g., Thomas, 1917c ; Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Reig, 1986 ), as we do here; see appropriate generic accounts for taxonomic histories. Karyotypic information for many species supplied by R. J. Baker et al. (1983a) , Gardner and Patton (1976) , and Haiduk et al. (1979) ; for morphological surveys, see Carleton (1973,1980), Hooper and Musser (1964a) , and Voss and Linzey (1981) . Much basic alpha-revision yet required.
Onychomys torridus (Coues, 1874) . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 26:183 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Arizona , Graham Co., Camp Grant . DISTRIBUTION: C California , S Nevada , and extreme SW Utah , USA , south to N Baja California, W Sonora, and northernmost Sinaloa , Mexico . SYNONYMS: clarus, knoxjonesi, longicaudus , macrotis , perpallidus , pulcher , ramona , tularensis, yakiensis. COMMENTS: See comments under O. arenicola . See McCarty (1975 , Mammalian Species, 59, including arenicola ). Hollander and Willig (1992) described the Sinoloan knoxjonesi.
Oligoryzomys victus (Thomas, 1898) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 1:178 . TYPE LOCALITY: Lesser Antilles, Saint Vincent . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Earlier classifications listed O. victus as an Oryzomys of uncertain affinity ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Goldman, 1918 ), and Hall and Kelson (1959) erroneously placed it with their “ tectus group" (= Oecomys ). Thomas (1898a) and later Ray (1962) emphasized its alliance with species of Oligoryzomys . Known only by the holotype ; presumably extinct (see Ray, 1962 ).
Onychomys leucogaster (Wied-Neuwied, 1841) . Reise in Nord-America, 2:99 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , North Dakota , Oliver Co., Mandan village near Fort Clark . DISTRIBUTION: S Alberta , Saskatchewan , and SW Manitoba , Canada , south through Great Plains and Great Basin region of USA , to N Tamaulipas , Mexico . SYNONYMS: albescens , arcticeps , breviauritus, brevicaudus , capitulatus, durranti, fuliginosus , fuscogriseus, longipes , melanophrys , missouriensis , pallescens, pallidus , ruidosae , utahensis. COMMENTS: Geographic variation and subspecific taxonomy reviewed for central Great Plains ( Engstrom and Choate, 1979 ) and for Great Basin region ( Riddle and Choate, 1986 ). Biogeographic scenario of intraspecific differentiation developed by Riddle and Choate (1986) . See McCarty (1978 , Mammalian Species, 87).
Onychomys arenicola Mearns, 1896 . Preliminary diagnosis of new mammals from the Mexican border of the U. S. , p. 3 (preprint of Proc. U. S. Natl. Mus., 19: 137 - 140). TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Texas , El Paso Co., 6 mi above El Paso . DISTRIBUTION: Chihuahuan Desert: SE Arizona , SC New Mexico , and W Texas , USA , south into C Mexico , to Aguascalientes , San Luis Potosi , and W Tamaulipas . SYNONYMS: canus , surrufus. COMMENTS: Placed in full synonymy of O. t. torridus by Hollister (1914) . Sympatry with O. torridus and karyotypic discrimination reported by Hinesley (1979) , who raised O. arenicola to species—also see Baker et al. (1979) . Sullivan et al. (1986) and Riddle and Honneycutt (1990) viewed O. leucogaster and O. arenicola as sister taxa. Specimenbased documentation of geographic range and synonymy of species-group taxa provisionally associated here under O. arenicola highly welcomed.
Onychomys Baird, 1858 . Mammalia in Repts. U.S. Expl. Surv., 8(1):458 . TYPE SPECIES: Hypudaeus leucogaster Wied-Neuwied, 1841 . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Revised by Hollister (1914) . Chromosomal evolution among three species investigated by Baker et al. (1979) , allozymic differentiation by Sullivan et al. (1986) , and mitochondrial-DNA phylogeny by Riddle and Honeycutt (1990) ; historical biogeography interpreted by Riddle and Honeycutt (1990) ; affinity of Recent and fossil forms evaluated by Carleton and Eshelman (1979) . Phyletic affinity to other sigmodontine genera assessed by Carleton (1980) , Hooper and Musser (1964b) , and Stangl and Baker (1984b) .
Oryzomys balneator Thomas, 1900 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 5:273 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Napo-Pastaza Prov., upper Rio Pastaza , Mirador, 1500 m . DISTRIBUTION: E and S Ecuador , N Peru . SYNONYMS: hesperus. COMMENTS: Relationships obscure; range extent uncertain.
Oryzomys auriventer Thomas, 1890 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 4, 7:379 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Tungurahua Prov. , upper Rio Pastaza , Mirador, 1500 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Ecuador and N Peru . SYNONYMS: nimbosus. COMMENTS: A subspecies of O. albigularis sensu Cabrera (1961) ; considered distinct by Gardner and Patton (1976) .
Oryzomys bolivaris J. A. Allen, 1901 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:405 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Bolivar Prov., Porvenir, 1800 m . DISTRIBUTION: Lowland evergreen forest from E Honduras , through E Nicaragua , Costa Rica and Panama , to W Colombia and W Ecuador . SYNONYMS: alleni , bombycinus , castaneus , orinus, rivularis. COMMENTS: Names conventionally applied to this species include bombycinus , as reviewed by Pine (1971), and rivularis, as discussed by Gardner and Patton (1976) . Priority of bolivaris presented by Musser and Gardner (in litt.), who summarized the morphological variation and geographic distribution of the species.
Oryzomys albigularis (Tomes, 1860) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1860:264 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Chimborazo Prov. , Pallatanga, 4950 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forests of N and W Venezuela , easternmost Panama , Andes of Colombia and Ecuador , to N Peru . SYNONYMS: caracolus , childi, maculiventer, meridensis , moerex, oconnelli, pectoralis , pirrensis , villosus . COMMENTS: Hershkovitz's (1944) footnoted listing of specific synonyms of O. albigularis set the precedent for Cabrera's (1961) arrangement of the South American forms as subspecies, a viewpoint reiterated in regional studies (e.g., Handley, 1966a , 1976). Gardner and Patton (1976) demonstrated the composite nature of Hershkovitz's (1944) and Cabrera's (1961) concept of albigularis ; however, the determination of priority and refinement of distributions require much museum-based research. Here we tentatively follow the taxonomy of Gardner and Patton (1976) and Patton et al. (1990) and recognize O. auriventer , O. devius , O. keaysi , and O. levipes as separate species (see those accounts). Gardner and Patton (1976) reassociated Cabrera's (1961) name-combination O. a. boliviae as a junior synonym of O. nitidus .
Oryzomys alfaroi (J. A. Allen, 1891) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 3:214 . TYPE LOCALITY: Costa Rica , Alajuela Prov. , San Carlos . DISTRIBUTION: Lowland to lower montane forests from S Tamaulipas and Oaxaca , Mexico , through Middle America, to W Colombia and Ecuador . SYNONYMS: agrestis , dariensis, gloriaensis, gracilis , incertus (of J. A. Allen, 1908 ), intagensis, palatinus , palmirae. COMMENTS: Goldman (1918) forged a broad definition of the species, expanded more so by Hall and Kelson (1959) , which encompassed many forms previously treated as distinct (e.g., Merriam, 1901). We recognize chapmani , rhabdops , and saturatior as species (revision in progress). Oryzomys alfaroi proper may be more closely related to melanotis-rostratus than to the chapmani-saturatior group. Karyotype reported by Haiduk et al. (1979) and Engstrom (1984) .
Oligoryzomys chacoensis (Myers and Carleton, 1981) . Mise. Pubi. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan , 161: 19 . TYPE LOCALITY: Paraguay , Boqueron Dept., km 419 along Trans Chaco Hwy, northwest of Villa Hayes . DISTRIBUTION: Dryer habitats of W Paraguay , SE Bolivia , WC Brazil , and N Argentina . May be more broadly distributed in cerrado and caatinga habitats in SE Brazil . COMMENTS: Karyotype reported by Myers and Carleton (1981) ; morphometric variation by Myers and Carleton (1981) and Olds and Anderson (1987) . Status with regard to O. andinus unresolved.
Oligoryzomys flavescens (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:19 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uruguay , Maldonado . DISTRIBUTION: SE Brazil , Uruguay , and Argentina (south to Chubut Prov. ). SYNONYMS: antoniae, occidentalis . COMMENTS: Chromosomal variation reported and taxonomic implications discussed by Sbalqueiro et al. (1991) .
Oligoryzomys andinus (Osgood, 1914) . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:156 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , La Libertad Dept., upper Rio Chicama, Hacienda Liagueda, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: W Peru and WC Bolivia ; geographic and altitudinal limits uncertain. COMMENTS: Karyotype reported by Gardner and Patton (1976) .
Oligoryzomys eliurus (Wagner, 1845) . Arch. Naturgesch., 11:147 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , São Paulo , Ytarare . DISTRIBUTION: C and SE Brazil . SYNONYMS: pygmaeus , utiaritensis . COMMENTS: Perhaps conspecific with O. nigripes (see Myers and Carleton, 1981 ).
Oligoryzomys delticola (Thomas, 1917) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 20:96 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Buenos Aires Prov. , Delta del Parana, Isla Ella, 1 m . DISTRIBUTION: EC Argentina , Uruguay , and S Brazil ( Rio Grande do Sul ).
Oligoryzomys destructor (Tschudi, 1844) . Fauna Peruana, 1:182 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Peru . DISTRIBUTION: Andes of S Colombia , through Ecuador and Peru , to WC Bolivia . SYNONYMS: maranonicus, melanostoma, spodiurus, stolzmanni . COMMENTS: Karyotype reported by Gardner and Patton (1976) as Oryzomys longicaudatus variant (4). As discussed by Hershkovitz (1940:81) , Tschudi's specimens may have originated from haciendas along the Rio Chinchao, Huanuco Dept., Peru , 900-1000 m .
Oligoryzomys arenalis (Thomas, 1913) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 12:571 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Lambayeque Dept., Eten, 10 m . DISTRIBUTION: Arid and semiarid coastal plain of Peru . COMMENTS: Level of relationship to O. fulvescens warrants clarification.
Oligoryzomys Bangs, 1900 . New England Zool. Club., 1:94 . TYPE SPECIES: Oryzomys navus Bangs, 1900 (= Hesperomys fulvescens Saussure, 1860 ). COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. Described as a subgenus of Oryzomys and usually recognized as such ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Hall, 1981 ; Tate, 1932e ) or as a genus ( Contreras and Berry, 1983 ; Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ), with Microryzomys as a full synonym ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Tate, 1932e ) or not (Cabrera, 1961). Diagnosis emended at the generic level by Carleton and Musser (1989) . Species-level revisions required: estimates range from one ( Hershkovitz, 1966c ) to 30 ( Tate, 1932e ), usually around 12 (Cabrera, 1961). Regional studies have recorded three or four species in sympatry or parapatry ( Contreras and Berry, 1983 ; Massoia, 1973 ; Myers and Carleton, 1981 ; Olds and Anderson, 1987 ). Karyology of many species presented in Espinosa and Reig (1991) , Gallardo and Patterson (1985) , Gardner and Patton (1976) , and Myers and Carleton (1981) . The species recognized here observe the preliminary review of Carleton and Musser (1989) .
Oligoryzomys griseolus (Osgood, 1912) . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:49 . TYPE LOCALITY: Venezuela , Tachira , upper Rio Tachira , west of Paramo de Tama, 6000-7000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Tachira Andes of W Venezuela and Cordillera Oriental of E Colombia . COMMENTS: As noted by Osgood (1912) , this distinctive form contrasts sharply with neighboring populations of O. fulvescens (e.g., navus and tenuipes ) and instead resembles O. vegetus of W Panama .
Oligoryzomys fulvescens (Saussure, 1860) . Revue Mag. Zool. Paris, ser. 2, 12: 102 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Veracruz , Orizaba (as restricted by Merriam, 1901:295) . DISTRIBUTION: W and E versants of S Mexico , through Mesoamerica, to Ecuador , northernmost Brazil , and Guianas in South America. SYNONYMS: costaricensis , creper , delicatus, engraciae, lenis, mayensis , messorius , munchiquensis, navus , nicaraguae , pacificus , reventazoni, tenuipes . COMMENTS: All Central American forms retained as subspecies (see Hall, 1981 ). Variable karyotypic descriptions intimate that more than one species occurs among the listed synonyms ( Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Haiduk et al., 1979 ).
Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (Bennett, 1832) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1832:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Valparaiso Prov. (as suggested by Osgood, 1943:143 ) . DISTRIBUTION: NC to S Andes, approximately to 50°S latitude, of Chile and Argentina . SYNONYMS: agilis , amblyrrhynchus, araucanus, commutatus, coppingeri, diminutivus, dumetorum, exiguus , glaphyrus, macrocercus , melaenus, melanizon, mizurus, nigribarbis, pernix, peteroanus, philippii, saltator . COMMENTS: Formerly encompassed most Andean populations of Oligoryzomys (see Cabrera, 1961). Morphometric variation among Chilean populations investigated by Gallardo and Palma (1990) , who placed philippii in full synonymy with O. longicaudatus and removed magellanicus to specific status. Relationships and level of divergence from allopatric forms like O. destructor and O. nigripes warrant study (see Carleton and Musser, 1989 ). Attribution of numerous Philippi (1900) epithets follows Osgood (1943) .
Oligoryzomys magellanicus (Bennett, 1836) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1835:191 [1836]. TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Magallanes Prov. , Straits of Magellan, Port Famine . DISTRIBUTION: S Patagonian region of Chile and Argentina , including Tierra del Fuego . COMMENTS: Karyotypic, morphometric, and phallic differention from O. longicaudatus supports the specific recognition of O. magellanicus ( Gallardo and Palma, 1990 ; Gallardo and Patterson, 1985 ).
Oligoryzomys microtis (Allen, 1916) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 35:525 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Amazonas, lower Rio Solimôes . DISTRIBUTION: C Brazil south of Rios Solimöes-Amazon, and contiguous lowlands of Peru , Bolivia , Paraguay , and Argentina . SYNONYMS: chaparensis, fornesi , mattogrossae . COMMENTS: Karyotype reported by Gardner and Patton (1976) as Oryzomys longicaudatus variant (2) and by Myers and Carleton (1981) as Oryzomys fornesi .
Oligoryzomys vegetus (Bangs, 1902) . Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 39:35 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Chiriqui Prov. , Volcan de Chiriqui , Boquete, 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Westernmost Panama ; limits uncertain. COMMENTS: Relegated to a subspecies of O. fulvescens by Goldman (1918) and so arranged thereafter (e.g., Hall, 1981 ). Bangs (1902) , however, correctly recognized the sympatry of his new species with O. fulvescens .
Oligoryzomys nigripes (Olfers, 1818) . In Eschwege, J. Brasilien , Neue Bibliothek. Reisenb., 15:209 . TYPE LOCALITY: Paraguay , Paraguari Dept., Ybycui National Park, 85 km SSE Atyra (as restricted by Myers and Carleton, 1981:14 ) . DISTRIBUTION: E Paraguay and N Argentina . COMMENTS: Neotype designated, diagnosis emended, and karyotype described by Myers and Carleton (1981) . Distributional extent unclear; relationship to allopatric forms such as eliurus and longicaudatus warrants investigation. Myers and Carleton (1981) recommended that Mus longitarsus Rengger, 1830 , which could apply to either O. microtis or O. nigripes , be considered a nomen dubium.
Chinchillula sahamae Thomas, 1898 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 1, 7:280 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , La Paz Dept., Esperanza, 50 km N Mount Sajama, Pacajes, 4200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Altipiano region of S Peru , W Bolivia , extreme NW Argentina , and N Chile .
Chelemys macronyx (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:362 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Mendoza Prov. , Fort San Rafael . DISTRIBUTION: E and W flanks of S Andes along Chile-Argentina boundary, about 34°S latitude south to Straits of Magellan. C Chilean distribution augmented by Pine et al. (1979) . SYNONYMS: alleni , connectens , fumosus , vestitus . COMMENTS: Treated as a subspecies of C. megalonyx by Mann (1978) and Tamayo and Frassinetti (1980) ; recognized as species by Osgood (1943) and Pearson (1984) . Osgood (1943) designated the skin of Notiomys connectens as the holotype of this composite specimen and synonymized it with [C.] macronyx vestitus .
Chilomys instans (Thomas, 1895) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:368 . TYPE LOCALITY: Colombia , Cundinamarca Dept., Bogota region, Hacienda de La Selva, 1380 m . DISTRIBUTION: N Andes, from N Ecuador through C and N Colombia , to W Venezuela . Venezuelan distribution amplified by Handley (1976) . SYNONYMS: fumeus .
Chibchanomys trichotis (Thomas, 1897) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 20:220 . TYPE LOCALITY: Colombia , "W. Cundinamarca." DISTRIBUTION: Highlands in W Venezuela , Colombia , and Peru . COMMENTS: Provenience of type, taxonomy, and distribution reviewed by Voss (1988) .
Chelemys megalonyx (Waterhouse, 1845) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1844:154 [1845]. TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Valparaiso Prov. , Lake Quintero . DISTRIBUTION: C Chile , Coquimbo Prov. south to Magallanes . SYNONYMS: delfini , microtis , niger , scalops. COMMENTS: The association of delfini — retained by Osgood (1943) as a species related to C. macronyx but listed as a subspecies of C. megalonyx by Tamayo and Frassinetti (1980) —needs resolution.
Chilomys Thomas, 1897 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 19:500 . TYPE SPECIES: Oryzomys instans Thomas, 1895 . COMMENTS: Arranged with oryzomyines ( Reig, 1984 ) but tribal affinity obscure; perhaps more closely related to thomasomyines. Aspects of morphology reported by Carleton (1973) and Voss and Linzey (1981) .
Chelemys (Thomas, 1903) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 12:242 . TYPE SPECIES: Akodon megalonyx Thomas, 1903 . COMMENTS: Akodontine. Named as a subgenus of Akodon , later ranked as a genus ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Reig, 1987; Thomas, 1927 ) or consolidated under Notiomys , together with Geoxus (Cabrera, 1961; Ellerman, 1941 ; Osgood, 1925 , 1943 ). Pearson (1984) enumerated diagnostic traits of these three long-clawed, semi-fossorial taxa, and Reig (1987) amplified their morphological definition. Chelemys angustus Thomas, 1927 , is based on a specimen of Akodon longipilis (see Pearson, 1984 ).
Chinchillula Thomas, 1898 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 1:280 . TYPE SPECIES: Chinchillula sahamae Thomas, 1898 . COMMENTS: Phyllotine. Revised by Hershkovitz (1962) ; karyology reviewed by Pearson and Patton (1976) .
Chibchanomys Voss, 1988 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 188:321 . TYPE SPECIES: Ichthyomys trichotis Thomas, 1897 . COMMENTS: Ichthyomyine. Described as a species of Ichthyomys , trichotis was thereafter associated first with Rheomys (Cabrera, 1961; Tate, 1932/1) and then Anotomys ( Handley, 1976 ) . Generic distinctiveness and phylogenetic relationships substantiated by Voss (1988) .
Eligmodontia F. Cuvier, 1837 . Ann. Sci. Nat. (Paris), ser. 2, 7:169 . TYPE SPECIES: Eligmodontia typus F. Cuvier, 1837 . SYNONYMS: Eligmodon, Heligmodontia . COMMENTS: A phyllotine member closely allied to Calomys ( Hershkovitz, 1962 ; Williams and Mares, 1978 ). Revised by Hershkovitz (1962) , who synonymized all forms as E. typus . Morphological, chromosomal, and distributional evidence, however, supports a view of greater species diversity (e.g., Kelt et al., 1991 ; Mann, 1978 ; Mares et al., 1989b ; Osgood, 1943 ). For example, Kelt et al. (1991) identified three chomosomal morphs to which they applied the names typus (2n=44), puerulus (2n=50), and morgani (2n=32). The association of names, particularly for typus and morgani , is based on the nearness of their sample localities to type localities. This is not the same as karyotyping topotypic animals or comparing karyotyped specimens to holotypes . In view of the complex interdigitation of specific ranges among the ridges and valleys of the southern Andes, the use of these chromosomal formulae as a diagnostic key to species identifications should be employed cautiously pending a full revision of the genus. Williams and Mares (1978) referred Graomys hypogaeus to synonymy under E. typus sensu lato and questioned whether the type is a composite specimen; resolution of its status and proper synonymy requires restudy of the holotype as part of a revision of Eligmodontia .
Delomys sublineatus (Thomas, 1903) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 12:240 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Espirito Santo , Engenheiro Reeve, 500 m . DISTRIBUTION: Atlantic coastal forest of SE Brazil , Espirito Santo to Paranâ .
Delomys dorsalis (Hensel, 1872) . Abh. König. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , p. 42 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Rio Grande do Sul . DISTRIBUTION: Atlantic coastal region of SE Brazil and extreme NE Argentina . SYNONYMS: collinus , lechei, obscura , plebejus .
Chroeomys jelskii (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:360 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Junfn Dept., Junfn . DISTRIBUTION: Altipiano of S Peru to WC Bolivia and NW Argentina . SYNONYMS: bacchante, cayllomae, cruceri, inambarii, inornatus , ochrotis, pulcherrimus , pyrrhotis, scalops, sodalis . COMMENTS: Revised by Sanborn (1947b) .
Chroeomys andinus (Philippi, 1858) . Arch. Naturgesh., 23(1):77 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Santiago Prov., Altos Andes . DISTRIBUTION: Peru , Bolivia , N Chile , N Argentina . SYNONYMS: dolichonyx. COMMENTS: Although not colorfully marked like C. jelskii , genetic data support the transfer of andinus to Chroeomys (see Smith and Patton, 1991 ).
Chroeomys Thomas, 1916 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 18:340 . TYPE SPECIES: Akodon pulcherrimus Thomas, 1897 (= Akodon jelskii Thomas, 1894 ). COMMENTS: Akodontine. Described as a genus ( Thomas, 1916c ) but afterwards conventionally viewed as a subgenus of Akodon (Cabrera, 1961; Ellerman, 1941 ; Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Reig, 1987). Among the most genetically divergent akodonts surveyed by Patton et al. (1989) and Smith and Patton (1991) , including species of typical Akodon , Bolomys , and Microxus , and recognized by those authors as a separate genus.
Delomys Thomas, 1917 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 20: 196 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys dorsalis Hensel, 1872 . COMMENTS: Thomasomyine. Delomys has variously stood as a genus ( Avila-Pires, 1960b ; Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Tate, 1932/) or placed within Thomasomys , with or without formal subgeneric division ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Moojen, 1952 ; Osgood, 1933d ). As remarked by Osgood (1933d) , Thomas in part created Delomys to taxonomically underscore the geographic disjunction between thomasomyines in SE Brazil and the diverse radiation of typical Thomasomys in the N Andes (e.g., see Reig, 1986 ). There are features that unite the forms of Delomys , but decision on its classificatory rank—and that of other SE Brazilian endemics like Wilfredomys , Rhagomys , and Phaenomys — must await broader-based phylogenetic inquiry involving Andean thomasomyines. Number of recognized species listed as four ( Moojen, 1952 ), three ( Reig, 1986 ), two ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ), or one ( Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Cabrera, 1961), a situation which advises that future list-making would profit from critical specimen examination. Here we recognize two, D. dorsalis and D. sublineatus , following the karyotypic study of Zanchin et al. (1992b) . Avila-Pires (1960b) associated Calomys plebejus Winge, 1887 , as another form of Delomys ; its status with regard to dorsalis and sublineatus warrents clarification.
Calomys callidus (Thomas, 1916) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 17:182 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Corrientes Prov. , Goya, 600 ft . DISTRIBUTION: EC Argentina and E Paraguay . COMMENTS: Diagnosed as a subspecies of C. venustus and recognized as such (e.g., Cabrera, 1961) until Hershkovitz (1962) placed it in synonymy with C. callosus callosus . Specific status of callidus affirmed by Corti et al. (1987) , who summarized its distribution and karyotypic discrimination.
Bolomys punctulatus (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser 6, 14:361 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador . DISTRIBUTION: Indeterminate area of Ecuador and perhaps Colombia . COMMENTS: Described as a species of Akodon but referred to a subspecies of Zygodontomys brevicauda by Hershkovitz (1962) . Voss (19916) recognized the Bolomys-like traits of punctulatus and provisionally retained it as a species while noting its similarity to B. lasiurus . The enigmatic distribution of the few fragmentary specimens assignable to punctulatus , which originate from a region outside of the currently-known geographic range of Bolomys , was discussed by Voss (1991 b) .
Bolomys obscurus (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uruguay , Maldonado . DISTRIBUTION: S Uruguay and EC Argentina . SYNONYMS: benefactus. COMMENTS: Type species of Cabreramys ( Massoia and Fornes, 1967 ) , considered a junior synonym of Bolomys by Reig (1987).
Calomys boliviae (Thomas, 1901) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 8:253 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , La Paz Dept., Rio Solocame, 1200 m . DISTRIBUTION: W Bolivia . SYNONYMS: fecundus . COMMENTS: Conventionally arranged as a subspecies or synonym of C. callosus (Cabrera, 1961; Hershkovitz, 1962 ). Use here follows informal listing of Reig (1986) , who included fecundus as a subjective synonym. Karyotype reported, as C. fecundus , by Pearson and Patton (1976) .
Bolomys temchuki (Massoia, 1980) . Hist. Nat., 1 (25):179 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Misiones Prov., Depto. Capital, en terrenos del INTA , Arroyo Zaiman . DISTRIBUTION: Region of Misiones, Argentina . SYNONYMS: elioi, liciae.
Calomys Waterhouse, 1837 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:21 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus (Calomys) bimaculatus Waterhouse, 1837 (= Mus laucha Fischer, 1814 ). SYNONYMS: Hesperomys . COMMENTS: Phyllotine. Cladistic position unclear, but generally viewed as a primitive clade relative to other phyllotine genera ( Hershkovitz, 1962 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ). Possible relationship of Calomys to North American Pliocene form Bensonomys debated by Baskin (1978 , 1986 ) and Reig (1980). Generic revision by Hershkovitz (1962) , who reduced the previously-recognized 10-15 species (e.g., Cabrera, 1961; Ellerman, 1941 ) to only four, two of which, laucha and callosus , have been later shown to be species complexes ( Corti et al., 1987 ; Massoia et al., 1968 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ; Reig, 1986 ; Williams and Mares, 1978 ). Regional names, however, are sometimes employed in contradictory or inconsistent fashion, which leaves unsettled the question of relationship to extraregional forms and the identification of older synonyms to be employed. The species listed here, their distributional extent, and the allocation of synonyms must be viewed cautiously pending another generic revision.
Calomys tener (Winge, 1887) . E Museo Lundii, 1 (3):15 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Rio das Velhas, Lagoa Santa . DISTRIBUTION: EC Brazil . COMMENTS: Arranged as a subspecies of C. laucha by Hershkovitz (1962) , but others have retained tener , along with C. laucha , as distinct species (Cabrera, 1961; Mares et al., 1989a ; Moojen, 1952 ), which suggests the need for further study of their level of differentiation.
Calomys sorellus (Thomas, 1900) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 6:297 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Libertad Dept., 8 mi S Huamachuco, 3500 m . DISTRIBUTION: Peruvian Andes, above 2000 m , from Dept. Libertad to Puno . SYNONYMS: frida , miurus . COMMENTS: Classified as a subspecies of C. lepidus (Cabrera, 1961) ; discrimination from and sympatry with C. lepidus documented by Hershkovitz (1962) , who relegated frida and miurus to synonymy under C. sorellus (also see Pearson and Patton, 1976 ).
Calomys musculinus (Thomas, 1913) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 11:138 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Jujuy Prov. , Maimara, 2230 m . DISTRIBUTION: N Argentina , E Paraguay . SYNONYMS: cordovensis, cortensis, murillus. COMMENTS: Included in C. laucha by Hershkovitz (1962) but morphological and karyotypic evidence supports its specific status ( Massoia et al., 1968 ; Pearson and Patton, 1976 ). Synonymy follows Contreras and Rosi (1980) ; Reig (1986) listed murillus as a species.
Calomys hummelincki (Husson, 1960) . Stud. Faun. Curacao Carib. Isl., 43:34 . TYPE LOCALITY: Netherlands West Indies, Curaçao , Klein Santa Martha . DISTRIBUTION: Llanos of NE Colombia ( La Guajira ), N Venezuela , and continental-shelf islands Curaçao and Aruba . COMMENTS: Originally named as a species of Baiomys ; included in C. laucha by Hershkovitz (1962) , who considered the Venezuelan populations to be introductions. Indigenous status reasserted by Handley (1976) .
Calomys callosus (Rengger, 1830) . Naturgesch. Säugeth. Paraguay , p. 231 . TYPE LOCALITY: Paraguay , Neembucu Dept., banks of Rio Paraguay opposite mouth of Rio Bermejo (as interpreted by Hershkovitz, 1962:172 ) . DISTRIBUTION: N Argentina , E Bolivia , W Paraguay , WC to EC Brazil (after Mares et al., 1981b , 1989a ). SYNONYMS: expulsus , muriculus , venustus . COMMENTS: Homogeneity of populations unified here should be viewed skeptically. According to Hershkovitz (1962) , callosus also encompassed boliviae (see species account), callidus (see species account), and fecundus (see C. boliviae ), together with species-group taxa enumerated above. Others have referenced, without explanation, muriculus ( Williams and Mares, 1978 ) and venustus ( Corti et al., 1987 ) as separate species, although Reig (1986) did not. Relationship and possible priority of venustus with respect to boliviae and fecundus especially merits study. Karyotype of nominate form published by Pearson and Patton (1976) .

Baiomys True, 1894 . Proc. U. S. Natl. Mus. (1893), 16:758 [1894]. TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys taylori Thomas, 1887 . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Revised by Packard (1960) . Relegated to a subgenus of Peromyscus by Osgood (1909) but reinstated as a separate genus by Miller (1912b) . Relationship to South American forms (e.g., Calomys ) advanced by Packard (1960) but other studies have disclosed cognate affinity to Scotinomys ( Carleton, 1980 ; Carleton et al., 1975; Hooper, 1960 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964a ). Karyology evaluated by Yates et al. (1979) and biochemical variation by Calhoun et al. (1989) . Hershkovitz (1962) transferred the form hummelincki , erroneously described under Baiomys , to the phyllotine genus Calomys .
Auliscomys Osgood, 1915 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:190 . TYPE SPECIES: Reithrodon pictus Thomas, 1884 . SYNONYMS: Loxodontomys . COMMENTS: Phyllotine. Alpha systematics revised by Pearson (1958) and Hershkovitz (1962) as part of Phyllotis . Diagnosed as a subgenus of Phyllotis ; variably recognized afterwards at that rank ( Osgood, 1947 ; Pearson, 1958 ) or as a genus ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Thomas, 1926a ). Recent evidence supports the monophyly and probable earlier divergence of Auliscomys ( Pearson and Patton, 1976 ; Simonetti and Spotorno, 1980 ).Chromosomal evolution of three of the four extant species presented by Walker and Spotorno (1992) .
Bibimys labiosus (Winge, 1887) . E Museo Lundii, 1 (3):25 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Pleistocene cave deposits near Lagoa Santa . DISTRIBUTION: Minas Gerais , Brazil . COMMENTS: Described as a species of Scapteromys , referred to Akodon by Hershkovitz (1966c) , and reidentified as a species of Bibimys by Massoia (1980a) . As with other sigmodontine species described by Winge (1887) from the Lagoa Santa caves, the relationship of B. labiosus to species named later warrants critical investigation (see Voss and Myers, 1991 ).
Bibimys chacoensis (Shamel, 1931) . J. Washington Acad. Sci., 21:247 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Chaco Prov. , Las Palmas . DISTRIBUTION: NE Argentina . COMMENTS: Described as a species of Akodon ; transferred to Bibimys by Massoia (1980a) , who noted the need to clarify the differentiation of this form from B. torresi .

Bibimys Masseria, 1979 . Physis, sec. C., 38(95):2 . TYPE SPECIES: Bibimys torresi Massoia, 1979 . COMMENTS: Diagnosed as a third genus of scapteromyines, also including Kunsia and Scapteromys (see Hershkovitz, 1966b ), and so maintained by Reig (1984 , 1986).
Bolomys Thomas, 1916 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 18:339 . TYPE SPECIES: Akodon amoenus Thomas, 1900 . SYNONYMS: Cabreramys . COMMENTS: Akodontine. After diagnosis as a genus, taxon retained as a subgenus of Akodon by Ellerman (1941) and Cabrera (1961). Emendation of diagnostic traits, synonymy of Cabreramys , and provisional list of species presented by Reig (1987). Complex taxonomic history and diagnosis further refined based on Bolivian species by Anderson and Olds (1989) . Chromosomal traits and inappropriate karyotypic references reviewed by Maia and Langguth (1981) and Reig (1987).
Blarinomys Thomas, 1896 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:310 . TYPE SPECIES: Oxymycterus breviceps Winge, 1887 . COMMENTS: Akodontine (see Reig, 1987).

DISTRIBUTION: E Bolivia , Paraguay , N Argentina , and Brazil south of the Amazon River. SYNONYMS: arviculoides, brachyurus , fuscinus , lasiotus (of Lund, 1838), lenguarum, pixuna , tapirapoanus . COMMENTS: Revised as part of Zygodontomys ( Hershkovitz, 1962 ) . Inclusion of lasiurus within Bolomys (or Akodon ), not Zygodontomys , supported by karyological and morphological information (see Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Maia and Langguth, 1981 ; Voss and Linzey, 1981 ). Geographic variation assessed by Macêdo and Mares (1987) , who retained only l. fuscinus and I. lasiurus as subspecies. They further placed lenguarum, a form tentatively retained as a species by Reig (1987) and Anderson and Olds (1989) , in synonymy under B. I. lasiurus .
Akodon urichi J. A. Allen and Chapman, 1897 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9: 19 . TYPE LOCALITY: Trinidad , Caparo . DISTRIBUTION: Trinidad , Tobago , Venezuela , E Colombia , N Brazil . SYNONYMS: chapmani , meridensis , saturatus , venezuelensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Gardner and Patton (1976) considered A. aerosus distinct from A. urichi .
Akodon torques (Thomas, 1917) . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 68:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Cuzco Dept., Machu Picchu, 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: E Andean cloud forest of SE Peru . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Relegated to a subspecies of A. orophilus (e.g., Cabrera, 1961), but recent studies have revealed that torques is a genetically distinctive form related to A. mollis (Patton et al., 1989, 1990). Described as a species of Microxus but considered a member of Akodon proper by later authors ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Patton et al., 1989; Thomas, 1927 ).

SYNONYMS: alterus, tucumanensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Karyology and morphometries reviewed, as A. boliviensis tucumanensis , by Barquez et al. (1980) . Myers et al. (1990) segregated spegazzinii , with tucumanensis as a subspecies, as a species distinct from A. boliviensis . Significance of marginal genetic and morphologic divergence of alterus evaluated by Blaustein et al. (1992) .

SYNONYMS: pervalens . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Retained as a species until Cabrera (1961) synonymized it as a race of A. azarae ; Myers (1989) tentatively listed sylvanus and azarae as separate species. The status and relationship of pervalens deserves resolution: retained as a nominal species similar to A. cursor by Myers (1989); placed as a synonym of A. serrensis by Hershkovitz (1990c) . Arrangment here follows the describer, Thomas (1925).
Akodon surdus Thomas, 1917 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 68(4):2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Cuzco Dept., Huadquina, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Andes of SE Peru . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Distribution and affinities little known; retained as a species by Reig (1987), Myers (1989), and Hershkovitz (1990c) .

DISTRIBUTION: Extreme S Chile and Argentina , including Tierra del Fuego . SYNONYMS: canescens, Hanoi . COMMENTS: Subgeneric allocation questionable: a member of Akodon following Patterson et al. (1984) or Abrothrix according to Reig (1987). Type locality, synonymy, distribution, and karyotype discussed by Patterson et al. (1984) , who judged the form infans, synonymized under A. xanthorhinus by Osgood (1943) , as a nomen dubium and considered Hanoi , described by Pine (1976), as a subjective synonym. Genetically highly differentiated from typical Akodon (see Apfelbaum and Reig, 1989 ).
Akodon varius Thomas, 1902 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:134 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , Cochabamba Dept., Cochabamba , 2400 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Andean slopes, 2000-3000 m , of W Bolivia .

COMMENTS: A phyllotine that includes forms formerly associated with Graomys . Morphological and karyotypic traits summarized by Olds et al. (1987), who emended the generic diagnosis.
Melanomys Thomas, 1902 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 10:248 . TYPE SPECIES: Oryzomys phaeopus Thomas, 1894 (= Hesperomys caliginosus Tomes, 1860 ). COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. A morphologically distinctive group usually arranged as a subgenus of Oryzomys since Goldman's (1918) revision (e.g., Tate, 1932e ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Cabrera, 1961; Hall, 1981 ). Allen (1913) , however, provided morphological criteria, as contrasted to the type species (= Mus palustris ) of Oryzomys , defending his retention of Melanomys as a genus; its synonymy in Oryzomys proper deserves more rigorous, character-based, phylogenetic substantiation. The taxon has not been revised; the nominal species listed stem from Cabrera (1961), who acknowledged his solely literature-based interpretation as provisional.
Lenoxus apicalis (J. A. Allen, 1900) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 13:224 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., Valley of Rio Inambari, Santo Domingo Mine, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Cloud forest of E Andean slopes in SE Peru and W Bolivia . SYNONYMS: boliviae .

TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Oaxaca , Distrito de Ixtlan, 13 mi NE Llano de las Flores, south slope Cerro Pelon, 9200 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Sierra de Juarez, NC Oaxaca , Mexico . COMMENTS: Named as a subspecies of Peromyscus thomasi . Citing morphological traits and genetic differentiation reported by Werbitsky and Kilpatrick (1987) , Carleton (1989) arranged cryophilus as a species.
Megalomys desmarestii (Fischer, 1829) . Synopsis Mamm., p. 316 . TYPE LOCALITY: Lesser Antilles, Martinique . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: Extinct. SYNONYMS: pilorides (of Desmarest, 1826).
Megalomys Trouessart, 1881 . Le Naturaliste, 1:357 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus desmarestii Fischer, 1829 . SYNONYMS: Moschomys (of Trouessart, 1903), Moschophoromys . COMMENTS: Named as a subgenus of the all-inclusive Hesperomys but later associated with Oryzomys by Major (1901) ; typically recognized as an oryzomyine genus endemic to the Lesser Antilles ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Hall, 1981 ; Tate, 1932c ). Closest mainland relative may be the poorly known Oryzomys hammondi of Ecuador ( Ray, 1962 ). Both species are extinct but persisted perhaps until the late 1800s ( Ray, 1962 ; Woods, 1989«).
Megadontomys Merriam, 1898 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 12:115 . TYPE SPECIES: Peromyscus thomasi Merriam, 1898 . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Used variably as a genus until Osgood (1909) stabilized its taxonomic ranking as a subgenus of Peromyscus , and so followed by Hooper and Musser (1964b) and Hooper (1968b) . Carleton (1980 , 1989) viewed the relationships and differentiation of Megadontomys at the generic level (but see Rogers, 1983). Aspects of morphology studied by Carleton (1973 , 1980 ), Hooper and Musser (1964b) , and Linzey and Layne (1969 , 1974 ). Karyological affinities evaluated by Rogers (1983), Rogers et al. (1984), and Stangl and Baker (1984b) . Werbitsky and Kilpatrick (1987) reported relatively low levels of genetic similarity between the nominal forms.
Neacomys pictus Goldman, 1912 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 60:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Darien Prov. , Cana, 1800 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from easternmost Panama . COMMENTS: Cabrera (1961) allocated pictus to subspecific standing under N. tenuipes , and Handley (1966a) concurred, but the relationship and status of this gracile form bear reexamination.

Microryzomys minutus (Tomes, 1860) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1860:215 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Chimborazo Prov. , probably near Pallatanga . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forest from N Venezuela , through Colombia , Ecuador and Peru , to WC Bolivia . SYNONYMS: aurillus, dryas , fulvirostris, humilior. COMMENTS: Formerly included altissimus as a subspecies by Osgood (1933a) , who also treated aurillus, humilior, and fulvirostris as subspecies. No races were deemed diagnosable by Carleton and Musser (1989) .
Microryzomys altissimus (Osgood, 1933) . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 20:5 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Pasco Dept., La Quinua, mountains north of Cerro de Pasco , 11,600 ft . DISTRIBUTION: High Andes of Colombia , Ecuador , and Peru . SYNONYMS: chotanus, hylaeus . COMMENTS: Diagnosed as a subspecies of Oryzomys minutus but elevated to species by Hershkovitz (1940) , who named two additional subspecies. Subspecific arrangement followed by Cabrera (1961) but none retained by Carleton and Musser (1989) .
Microryzomys Thomas, 1917 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 68:1 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys minutus Tomes, 1860 . SYNONYMS: Thallomyscus . COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. Named as a subgenus of Oryzomys and either retained as such (Cabrera, 1961; Ellerman, 1941 ; Osgood, 1933a ) or placed in synonymy with Oligoryzomys ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Tate, 1932e ; Thomas, 1926c ). Junior synonymy of Thallomyscus established by Osgood (1933a) . Raised to genus by Carleton and Musser (1984) and later revised by them (1989).
Neacomys Thomas, 1900 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 5:153 . TYPE SPECIES: Hesperomys spinosus Thomas, 1882 . COMMENTS: Oryzomyine. Recent revisionary standard lacking other than regional review of Lawrence (1941) and faunal checklists (e.g., Handley, 1966a , 1976; Husson, 1978 ). Traits for species recognition and distributional limits poorly delineated.
Isthmomys Hooper and Musser, 1964 . Occas. Pap. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan , 635:12 . TYPE SPECIES: Megadontomys flavidus Bangs, 1902 . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Species associated here were originally classified in Megadontomys , used either as a genus or as a subgenus of Peromyscus ( Osgood, 1909 ) . Isthmomys was later diagnosed as a subgenus of Peromyscus ( Hooper and Musser, 1964b ) and maintained at this rank by Hooper (1968b) ; accorded generic status by Carleton (1980 , 1989). Sister-group relationship with Megadontomys proposed by Carleton (1980) but unsupported by chromosomal banding data ( Stangl and Baker, 1984b ). Aspects of morphology considered by Carleton (1973 , 1980 ), Hooper and Musser (1964b) , and Linzey and Layne (1969 , 1974 ); karyology by Stangl and Baker (1984b) .
Ichthyomys pittieri Handley and Mondolfi, 1963 . Acta Biol. Venezuela , 3:417 . TYPE LOCALITY: Venezuela , Aragua, Rancho Grande, near headwaters of Rio Limon . DISTRIBUTION: N Venezuela . COMMENTS: Known by four specimens from the Carribean Coastal Range of Venezuela . Taxonomy reviewed by Voss (1988) .
Irenomys tarsalis (Philippi, 1900) . Ann. Mus. Nac. Chile Zool., 14: 10 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Valdivia Prov., Fundo San Juan, near La Union . DISTRIBUTION: C and S Chile , including Chiloe and Guaitecas Islands, and adjacent Argentina ( Neuquen Prov. ). SYNONYMS: longicaudatus .
Holochilus sciureus Wagner, 1842 . Arch. Naturgesch., ser. 8, 1:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Rio Sâo Francisco . DISTRIBUTION: Broad reaches of Orinoco and Amazon river basins: E and S Venezuela , Guianas, N and C Brazil , and Amazonian regions of Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia . SYNONYMS: amazonicus , berbericensis, guianae , incarum, nanus , venezuelae . COMMENTS: Discrimination from H. brasiliensis documented by Massoia (1980 a, 1981 ), who raised sciureus to specific rank. Many forms swept under Hershkovitz's (1955a) concept of brasiliensis actually belong to this "species," which itself may be a composite. Reig (1986) , for instance, listed amazonicus , guianae , and venezuelae as probable valid species, a taxonomy which should be given empirical testing (also see Aguilera and Perez-Zapata, 1989 ).
Ichthyomys tweedii Anthony, 1921 . Am. Mus. Novit., 20:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Prov. El Oro , Portovelo, 615 m . DISTRIBUTION: W Ecuador and C Panama . SYNONYMS: caurinus . COMMENTS: Taxonomy and distribution reviewed by Voss (1988) , who placed caurinus in full synonymy.
Ichthyomys stolzmanni Thomas, 1893 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1893:339 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Junin Dept., Chanchamayo, near Tarma, 923 m . DISTRIBUTION: Ecuador and Peru . SYNONYMS: orientalis . COMMENTS: Taxonomy and distribution reviewed by Voss (1988) , who retained orientalis as a subspecies.
Ichthyomys hydrobates (Winge, 1891) . Vidensk. Medd. Nat. Foren. Kjobenhavn, ser. 5, 3:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Venezuela , Mérida , Sierra de Mérida . DISTRIBUTION: W Venezuela , Colombia , and Ecuador . SYNONYMS: nicefori , soderstromi. COMMENTS: The holotype may have originated from the vicinity of Mérida , 1600-1700 m ( Voss, 1988 ). Taxonomy and distribution reviewed by Voss (1988) , who retained nicefori and soderstromi as subspecies.
Ichthyomys Thomas, 1893 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1893:337 . TYPE SPECIES: Ichthyomys stolzmanni Thomas, 1893 . COMMENTS: Ichthyomyine. Revised by Voss (1988) , who defined four species among the eight described taxa, and studied phylogenetic relationships.
Irenomys Thomas, 1919 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 3:201 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus tarsalis Philippi, 1900 . COMMENTS: Closest generic relatives obscure; usually grouped with phyllotines ( Olds and Anderson, 1989 ; Vorontsov, 1959 ).
Lenoxus Thomas, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:236 . TYPE SPECIES: Oxymycterus apicalis J. A. Allen, 1900 . COMMENTS: Akodontine. Viewed as closely related to Oxymycterus by Reig (1987), but electrophoretic data reveal Lenoxus as the most highly differentiated sister taxon to all other akodonts surveyed, including Oxymycterus (Patton et al., 1989) .
Isthmomys pirrensis (Goldman, 1912) . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 60(2):5 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Darien Prov. , Mount Pirri, headwaters of Rio Limon, 4500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Easternmost Panama and perhaps adjacent Colombia .
Kunsia fronto (Winge, 1887) . E Museo Lundii, 1 (3):44 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Rio das Velhas, Pleistocene cave deposits near Lagoa Santa . DISTRIBUTION: Isolated localities in NE Argentina and EC Brazil ; range poorly documented. SYNONYMS: chacoensis , planaltensis. COMMENTS: Taxonomy and distribution reviewed by Avila-Pires (1972) .
Kunsia tomentosus (Lichtenstein, 1830) . Darst. Säugeth., 7(15):33 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , southeastern area along the Rio Uruguay (as restricted by Hershkovitz, 1966c:120 ) . DISTRIBUTION: NE Bolivia ( Beni Prov. ) and WC Brazil ( Mato Grosso ); Pleistocene cave samples in Minas Gerais , Brazil . SYNONYMS: gnambiquarae, principalis . COMMENTS: Rare in collections; range inadequately known. See Massoia and Fornes (1965) and Hershkovitz (1966c) for justification of synonymy.
Juscelinomys candango Moojen, 1965 . Rev. Brasil . Biol., 25:281 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Federal District , Brasilia, Parque Zoobotanico, 1030 m . DISTRIBUTION: C Brazil .
Juscelinomys vulpinus (Winge, 1887) . E Museo Lundii, 1 (3):36 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Pleistocene cave deposits near Lagoa Santa . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Moojen (1965) provisionally referred Winge's Oxymycterus vulpinus to Juscelinomys . The present existence of J. vulpinus in the region and its status with respect to J. candango invite attention (see Voss and Myers, 1991 ).
Isthmomys flavidus (Bangs, 1902) . Bull. Mus. Comp. Zool., 9:27 . TYPE LOCALITY: Panama , Chiriqui Prov. , Volcan de Chiriqui , Boquete . DISTRIBUTION: Intermediate elevations in W Panama ( Chiriqui region ) and on Azuero Peninsula (see Handley, 1966a ). COMMENTS: Whether I. pirrensis is a junior synonym of I. flavidus , as opined by Hooper (1968b) , has yet to be assessed.
Kunsia Hershkovitz, 1966 . Z. Säugetierk., 31 (2):112 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus tomentosus Lichtenstein, 1830 . COMMENTS: Species formerly included in Scapteromys until set apart in Kunsia by Hershkovitz (1966c) , who arranged both genera in the scapteromyine "group," which he viewed as closely related to oxymycterines. Formal tribal segregation of the two genera affirmed by Reig (1980). Karyology summarized by Gardner and Patton (1976) .
Juscelinomys Moojen, 1965 . Rev. Brasil . Biol., 25:281 . TYPE SPECIES: Juscelinomys candango Moojen, 1965 . COMMENTS: Little information available beyond original description; believed to be "an akodontine closely related to Oxymycterus and Lenoxus " (Reig, 1987:361).
Habromys simulatus (Osgood, 1904) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 17:72 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Veracruz , near Jico, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Restricted area on E slopes of Sierra Madre Oriental, C Veracruz , Mexico . COMMENTS: Known by only three specimens —the type, paratype , and one from near Zacualpan, Veracruz (see Robertson and Musser, 1976 ); distributional limits unknown.
Habromys lophurus (Osgood, 1904) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 17:72 . TYPE LOCALITY: Guatemala , Huehuetenango , Todos Santos, 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Highlands of Chiapas , Mexico , C Guatemala , and NW El Salvador . COMMENTS: Robertson and Musser (1976) noted much diversity among their samples of H. lophurus .
Graomys griseoflavus (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:28 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Rio Negro Prov., mouth of Rio Negro . DISTRIBUTION: S Bolivia , W Paraguay , and nearby Brazil , south to S Chubut Prov. , Argentina . SYNONYMS: cachinus , centralis , chacoensis , lockwoodi , médius . COMMENTS: Even with removal of G. domorum , specific homogeneity of included populations and list of species-group synonyms remain highly suspect.
Habromys lepturus (Merriam, 1898) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 12:118 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Oaxaca , Cerro Zempoaltepec, 8200 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Cloud forests on Cerro Zempoaltepec and Sierra de Juarez, NC Oaxaca , Mexico . SYNONYMS: ixtlani . COMMENTS: Musser (1969a) arranged the distinctive form ixtlani as a subspecies.
Habromys chinanteco (Robertson and Musser, 1976) . Occas. Pap. Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kansas , 47:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Oaxaca , north slope Cerro Pelon, 31.6 km S Vista Hermosa, 2650 m . DISTRIBUTION: Vicinity of the type locality in the Sierra de Juarez, NC Oaxaca , Mexico . COMMENTS: A small-bodied species morphologically similar to H. simulatus and sympatric with H. lepturus (see Robertson and Musser, 1976 ).
Graomys edithae Thomas, 1919 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 3:495 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , La Rioja Prov., Otro Cerro, about 18 km NNW Chumbicha, 3000 m . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Status uncertain—placed as a synonym of G. griseoflavus by Cabrera (1961) or retained as a nominal species of Phyllotis ( Hershkovitz, 1962 ) or of Graomys ( Myers, 1977 ; Williams and Mares, 1978 ). Reinvestigation of the original type series, reportedly acquired in near sympatry with cachinus and médius ( Thomas, 1919 ) , would shed much light.
Graomys domorum (Thomas, 1902) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:132 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , Cochabamba Dept., Tapacari, 3000 m . DISTRIBUTION: E slopes of Andes of SC Bolivia and NW Argentina . SYNONYMS: taterona. COMMENTS: Ranked as a subspecies of G. griseoflavus by Hershkovitz (1962) . Chromosomal divergence reported by Pearson and Patton (1976) , who reinstated domorum as a species (also see Olds et al., 1987). Reig (1978) followed Cabrera (1961) in allocating taterona to G. domorum .
Habromys (Hooper and Musser, 1964) . Occas. Pap. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan , 635:12 . TYPE SPECIES: Peromyscus lepturus Merriam, 1898 . COMMENTS: Peromyscine. Circumscribes species originally placed with the Peromyscus mexicanus complex, subgenus Peromyscus ( Osgood, 1909 ) . Hooper and Musser (1964b) acknowledged their distinctive morphology as the subgenus Habromys of Peromyscus (and Hooper, 1968b ), a clade which Carleton (1980) viewed at the generic level. Systematic evidence weakly supports common ancestry of Habromys with Neotomodon and/ or Podomys ( Carleton, 1980 ; Hooper and Musser, 1964b ; Stangl and Baker, 1984b ). Male reproductive tract examined by Hooper (1958) , Hooper and Musser (1964b) , and Linzey and Layne (1969 , 1974 ).
Holochilus chacarius Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:446 . TYPE LOCALITY: Paraguay , eastern Chaco, one league NW Concepcion , 500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Paraguay and NE Argentina . SYNONYMS: balnearum. COMMENTS: Considered distinct by Massoia (1980a) , who treated balnearum as a synonym; Reig (1986) mentioned balnearum as another good species. Highly variable in diploid and fundamental numbers ( Vidal et al., 1976 ; Nachman and Myers, 1989 ).
Hodomys alleni (Merriam, 1892) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 7:168 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Colima , Manzanillo . DISTRIBUTION: Southernmost Sinaloa to Oaxaca ; interior Mexico along basin of Rio Balsas to central Puebla . SYNONYMS: elattura, guerrerensis , vetulus . COMMENTS: Kelson (1952) placed vetulus as a subspecies of N. alleni . See Genoways and Birney, 1974 (Mammalian Species, 41, as Neotoma alleni ), who first reported the karyotype (2n=48).
Holochilus brasiliensis (Desmarest, 1819) . Nouv. Diet. Hist. Nat., Nouv. ed., 29:62 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Minas Gerais , Lagoa Santa (as restricted by Hershkovitz, 1955a:662 ) . DISTRIBUTION: SE Brazil , Uruguay , and EC Argentina . SYNONYMS: darwini , leucogaster , russatus , vulpinus . COMMENTS: Morphological definition and geographic range reduced in scope by Massoia (1980 a, 1981 ), who segregated H. sciureus as a species distinct from H. brasiliensis .
Holochilus Brandt, 1835 . Mem. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersbourg, ser. 6, 3(2):428 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus (Holochilus) leucogaster Brandt, 1835 (= Mus brasiliensis Desmarest, 1819 ). COMMENTS: Arranged by Hershkovitz (1955a) as one of four genera of sigmodont rodents. Based on reproductive anatomy, Hooper and Musser (1964a) remarked that Holochilus may represent a "well differentiated oryzomyine rather than a sigmodont." Standard karyotypic data have provided little resolution of generic affinities ( Gardner and Patton, 1976 ) but g-banded evaluations supported an oryzomyine affiliation (R. J. Baker et al., 1983a ). Retained, with Sigmodon proper, in the tribe Sigmodontini by Reig (1984 , 1986). Genus revised by Hershkovitz (1955a) , who consolidated 13 nominal species (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ) under H. brasiliensis and diagnosed a new one, H. magnus . Subsequent studies have revealed that brasiliensis of Hershkovitz (1955a) is a composite of three or more species ( Aguilera and Perez-Zapata, 1989 ; Gardner and Patton, 1976 ; Massoia, 1980 a, 1981 ; Reig, 1986 ). In general, evidence for the species acknowledged below issues from more localized studies that lack the perspective of a full generic review; these names, distributions, and synonyms must therefore be accepted as tentative pending such a synoptic revision. Association of synonyms basically observes the species classification of Massoia (1980a) .
Hodomys Merriam, 1894 . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 46:232 . TYPE SPECIES: Neotoma alleni Merriam, 1892 . COMMENTS: Neotomine. Maintained as a genus (e.g., Goldman, 1910 ; Ellerman, 1941 ) until arranged as a subgenus of Neotoma by Burt and Barkalow (1942) . Carleton (1980) expressed relationships and differentiation of Hodomys at the generic rank, perhaps closely related to Xenomys (also see Carleton, 1973 ; Hooper, 1960 ; and Schaldach, 1960 ).
Holochilus magnus Hershkovitz, 1955 . Fieldiana Zool., 37:657 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uruguay , about 40 km south Treinta y Très , Rio Cebollati, Paso de Averias . DISTRIBUTION: Uruguay and southernmost Brazil ; not recorded from Argentina ( Olrog and Lucero, 1981 ). COMMENTS: Massoia (1980a) referred Winge's (1887) Hesperomys molitor to Holochilus and noted its close resemblance to H. magnus ; their relationship and status warrant additional study (also see Voss and Myers, 1991 ). Banded karyotypic comparisons of H. magnus and H. brasiliensis presented by Freitas et al. (1983).
Euneomys chinchilloides (Waterhouse, 1839) . Zool. Voy. H. M. S. "Beagle", Mammalia, p. 72 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Tierra del Fuego, Straits of Magellan, south shore near eastern entrance . DISTRIBUTION: Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, neighboring islands, and southernmost Chile ; limits uncertain. SYNONYMS: ultimus . COMMENTS: Hershkovitz (1962) had suggested that other nominal species would prove to be synonyms of E. chinchilloides . This taxonomy has been followed ( Mann, 1978 ; Yanez et al., 1987 ) but misrepresents species diversity in the genus (see Pearson and Christie, 1991 ).
Eligmodontia moreni Thomas, 1896 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:307 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , La Rioja Prov., Chilecito, 1200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Atlantic-facing Andean slopes at intermediate elevations. El Salta to Neuquen Prov. , NW Argentina ; limits poorly documented. COMMENTS: Mares et al. (1981 b , 1989b ) noted the morphological, distributional, and ecological distinction of E. moreni and E. puerulus in El Salta Prov. , Argentina . The differentiation of moreni from morgani in the S Andes and from typus in the Pampas warrants further study.
Eligmodontia morgani Allen, 1901 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 14:409 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Santa Cruz Prov., basaltic canyons 50 mi SE Lake Buenos Aires . DISTRIBUTION: W Patagonian region of S Argentina and adjacent Chile ; limits of distribution unknown, perhaps as far north as Neuquen Prov. , Argentina . COMMENTS: This species epithet was used by Kelt et al. (1991) for the 2n=32 chromosomal form but whether this karyotype characterizes animals from the type locality needs verification. Other forms of Eligmodontia occur in the area.
Eligmodontia typus F. Cuvier, 1837 . Ann. Sci. Nat. (Paris), ser. 2, 7:169 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , " Buenos Aires ." DISTRIBUTION: C Argentina and contiguous parts of Chile ; range uncertain. SYNONYMS: elegans , pamparum. COMMENTS: Hershkovitz (1962:185) discussed the uncertainty of the type locality (also see Orteils et al., 1989:138), which should be formally restricted in order to settle the morphological identification of E. typus and promote a critical definition of the species within the genus.
Eligmodontia puerulus (Philippi, 1896) . Anal. Mus. Nac. Chile , Zool. Ent., 13a:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Antofagasta Prov. , San Pedro de Atacama, 3223 m . DISTRIBUTION: Altipiano of extreme S Peru , through NE Chile and W Bolivia , to NW Argentina . SYNONYMS: hirtipes , jacunda, marica , tarapacensis. COMMENTS: Reduced to a subspecies of E. typus by Hershkovitz (1962) but morphological ( Mann, 1978 ; Osgood, 1943 ) and karyotypic ( Kelt et al., 1991 ; Orteils et al., 1989) data sustain the specific recognition of E. puerulus .
Euneomys Coues, 1874 . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 26:185 . TYPE SPECIES: Reithrodon chinchilloides Waterhouse, 1839 . SYNONYMS: Bothriomys , Chelemyscus . COMMENTS: Phyllotine. Few specimens exist to substantiate the specific taxonomy and distribution of the genus. Revised by Hershkovitz (1962) , who acknowledged several nominal species but indicated their probable synonymy under E. chinchilloides , as Mann (1978) so formalized for Chilean populations. Yanez et al. (1987) summarized extant specimen data for Euneomys and concluded that one species is represented. Others have recognized two or more (e.g., Osgood, 1943 ; Pearson and Christie, 1991 ; Pine et al., 1979 ). The latter arrangement is more nearly correct but must be sustained within the context of rigorous revisions. Holotype of Reithrodon fossor Thomas, 1899 , type species of Chelemyscus Thomas, 1925 , is a composite, the designated type skull referrable to Euneomys ( Osgood, 1943: 164 ; Pearson, 1984:231 ).
Graomys Thomas, 1916 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 17: 141 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus griseoflavus Waterhouse, 1837 . COMMENTS: Phyllotine. Previously included in Phyllotis as a formal subgeneric division ( Osgood, 1947 ; Pearson, 1958 ) or not ( Hershkovitz, 1962 ). Returned to generic stature based on karyological data ( Pearson and Patton, 1976 ) and other traits (see Reig, 1978 ; Olds and Anderson, 1989 ). Williams and Mares (1978) transferred Graomys pearsoni Myers, 1977 , to Andalgalomys and synonymized G. hypogaeus in Eligmodontia typus .
Geoxus valdivianus (Philippi, 1858) . Arch. Naturgesch., 24(1):303 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Valdivia Prov . DISTRIBUTION: C and S Chile , including Mocha and Chiloe islands, to Straits of Magellan, and S Argentina ( Neuquen Prov. to Chubut ). SYNONYMS: araucanus, bicolor , bullocki, chiloensis, fossor , michaelseni, microtis . COMMENTS: Pearson (1984) noted that the generic association and specific status of michaelseni, arranged by Osgood (1943) as a subspecies, are uncertain.
Euneomys mordax Thomas, 1912 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 10:410 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Fort San Rafael; uncertain, probably not the San Rafael in Mendoza Prov. (see Pearson and Christie, 1991 ) . DISTRIBUTION: WC Argentina and adjacent region of Chile (Santiago and Malleco Provs.); range limits unknown. SYNONYMS: noei . COMMENTS: Pearson and Christie (1991) treated noei as conspecific with E. mordax .
Euneomys fossor (Thomas, 1899) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 4:280 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , "Prov. Salta ." DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality, which is questionable as Euneomys is otherwise unrecorded this far north in Argentina (see Mares et al., 1989b ). COMMENTS: Status doubtful—"the name Chelemyscus fossor should be attached to an appropriate species of Euneomys by some future revisor" ( Pearson, 1984:231 ).
Galenomys garleppi (Thomas, 1898) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 1:279 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bolivia , La Paz Dept., Esperanza, northeast of Mount Sajama, 4140 m . DISTRIBUTION: Altipiano of S Peru , N Chile , and adjacent Bolivia .
Euneomys petersoni J. A. Allen, 1903 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 19:192 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Santa Cruz Prov., upper Rio Chico, near the Cordilleras . DISTRIBUTION: Extreme S Argentina and adjacent Chile , excluding Tierra del Fuego; limits uncertain. SYNONYMS: dabbenei. COMMENTS: Relegated to a subspecies of E. chinchilloides by Hershkovitz (1962) and Pearson and Christie (1991) , but Osgood (1943) had noted the nearby occurrence of E. petersoni and E. chinchilloides without evidence of intergradation.
Galenomys Thomas, 1916 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 17:143 . TYPE SPECIES: Phyllotis garleppi Thomas, 1898 . COMMENTS: Phyllotine. Named as a subgenus of Euneomys , later elevated to genus (Thomas, 1926«), and reassociated as a subgenus of Phyllotis ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Osgood, 1947 ). Revised by Hershkovitz (1962) , who considered Galenomys a distinct genus, as did Pearson (1958) .
Geoxus Thomas, 1919 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 3:207 . TYPE SPECIES: Oxymycterus valdivianus Philippi, 1858 . COMMENTS: Akodontine. Revised by Osgood (1925 , 1943 ) as part of Notiomys — see remarks under Chelemys .
Delanymys brooksi Hayman, 1962 . Rev. Zool. Bot. Afr., 65:1 -2. TYPE LOCALITY: SW Uganda , Kigezi, near Kanaba, Echuya (or Muchuya) Swamp, 7500 ft (see Hayman, 1962) . DISTRIBUTION: SW Uganda , Zaire (Kivu), and Rwanda (Volcanos and Nyungwe forest). COMMENTS: Available information on morphology, geographic distribution, and ecology can be found in Hayman (1962, 1963a), Verheyen (1965b) , Dieterlen (1969b) , and Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1983) .
Petromyscus barbouri Shortridge and Carter, 1938 . Ann. S. Afr. Mus., 32:288 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , NW Cape Province , Little Namaqualand, Witwater, Kamiesberg, 3500-3800 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Springbok and Kamiesberg regions and Loeriesfontein area in Little Namaqualand, NW Cape Province , South Africa (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:315 ); limits unknown. COMMENTS: Although listed as a subspecies of P. collinus by Meester et al. (1986) , P. barbouri is separated from P. collinus not only by the diagnostic short and bicolored tail noted by Shortridge and Carter (1938) , but by its smaller skull, relatively shorter rostrum, much shorter molar rows, and lack of postaxillary teats.
Petromyscus collinus (Thomas and Hinton, 1925) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1925:237 . TYPE LOCALITY: Namibia , Damaraland, Karibib, northwest of Windhoek, 3142 ft . DISTRIBUTION: From Kaokoveld region in N Namibia south through Namibia to extreme NW Cape Prov. of South Africa south of the Orange River in Goodhouse and Pella areas; also recorded from C and W Cape Prov. and SW Angola by Skinner and Smithers (1990:314) . SYNONYMS: bruchus , capensis , kaokoensis, kurzi, namibensis, rufus , variabilis . COMMENTS: Roberts (1951) listed capensis , known only from Goodhouse, as a species, and Meester et al. (1986) treated it as a synonym of barbouri . In describing it as a subspecies of P. collinus , however, Shortridge and Carter (1938) reflected its true affinities because its morphology is unlike P. barbouri , which Shortridge and Carter described in the same paper and knew well. Roberts (1951) also treated bruchus (type locality is Great Brukkaros Mtn in S Namibia ) as a separate species, allocating the northern shortridgei to it as a subspecies. The latter is clearly a species separate from P. collinus (see comments under shortridgei ), but the status of bruchus will have to be illuminated in a revision of Petromyscus ; the few specimens we studied from Great Brukkaros Mtn were examples of P. collinus .
Subfamily Petromyscinae Roberts, 1951 . Mammals S Africa, p. 434 . COMMENTS: Of the two genera in this subfamily, Delanymys and Petromyscus, Lavocat (1964) wrote that their molar cusp patterns showed structural links between Mystromys and the dendromurines, a view shared by Verheyen (1965b) . Petter (1967b) , however, interpreted the derived molar traits shared by Delanymys and Petromyscus to indicate close phylogenetic alliance and he united them in the subfamily Petromyscinae , also pointing out that they had no close relationship to dendromurines. Carleton and Musser (1984) provided a diagnosis, characterization, and other remarks on contents and definition of the Petromyscinae . They also noted that aside from the shared molar peculiarities, the two genera are very different from one another and may not be part of the same monophyletic group. The subfamily is represented in the Plio-Pleistocene by the South African Stenodontomys darti ( Pocock, 1987 ) .
Delanymys Hayman, 1962 . Rev. Zool. Bot. Afr., 65:1 -2. TYPE SPECIES: Delanymys brooksi Hayman, 1962 .
Petromyscus Thomas, 1926 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9,17:179 . TYPE SPECIES: Praomys collinus Thomas and Hinton, 1925 . COMMENTS: Most faunal lists, either without question or with reservations, recognized only two species (Ellerman et al., 1953; Meester et al., 1986 ), but our study of museum specimens and original descriptions of taxa revealed the presence of four distinctive species, a conclusion also recorded by Skinner and Smithers (1990) .
Typhlomys cinereus Milne-Edwards, 1877 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, ser. 6, 12:9 [1877]. TYPE LOCALITY: China , W Fujian . DISTRIBUTION: S China ( Yunnan , Fujian , Guangxi , and S Anhui ); records are from montane forest (Allen, 1940; Wu and Wang, 1984 ; Liu et al., 1985 ). SYNONYMS: jindongensis. COMMENTS: Wu and Wang (1984) described jindongensis as a subspecies of T. cinereus .
Petromyscus shortridgei Thomas, 1926 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1926:302 . TYPE LOCALITY: Extreme S Angola , Rua Cana Falls, 3350 ft . DISTRIBUTION: W and S Angola and N Namibia (S to Erongo Mtns and Okahandja region); limits unknown; see map in Skinner and Smithers (1990:316) . COMMENTS: Roberts (1951) treated shortridgei as a subspecies of P. bruchus , and Meester et al. (1986) listed it as a subspecies of P. collinus . However, Thomas correctly expressed the distinctness of the animal by describing it as a species, which was also Schlitter's evaluation (in Meester et al., 1986 ), and that of Skinner and Smithers (1990) . The larger size of shortridgei , darker fur with a less silky texture, and lack of postaxillary teats clearly separate it from P. collinus , a judgement based upon specimens in the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum of Natural History. Our estimate of its geographic range, which overlaps that of P. collinus , is also derived from those series.
Petromyscus monticularis (Thomas and Hinton, 1925) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1925:238 . TYPE LOCALITY: Namibia , Great Namaqualand, Great Brukkaros Mtn, near Berseba . DISTRIBUTION: S Namibia : vicinity of type locality and south of there between Aus region in the west and South African border near Rietfontein area in the east. South Africa : in extreme N Cape Prov. on south bank of the Orange River at Augrabies Falls (USNM 452333). COMMENTS: Geographic limits of this distinctive species have yet to be determined.
Typhlomys chapensis Osgood, 1932 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist., Zool. Ser., 18:298 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Vietnam , Chapa . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Originally described as subspecies of T. cinereus , but its far greater size, pointed out by Osgood, clearly distinguishes it from the Chinese species. Still only represented by the 14 specimens "obtained by Delacour and Lowe at Chapa, all received from native collectors" ( Osgood, 1932:298 ).
Platacanthomys lasiurus Blyth, 1859 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 28:289 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Malabar, Alipi . DISTRIBUTION: Forests below 3000 ft in S India . COMMENTS: Known by very few specimens.
Typhlomys Milne-Edwards, 1877 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, ser. 6, 12:9 [1877]. TYPE SPECIES: Typhlomys cinereus Milne-Edwards, 1877 . COMMENTS: The Miocene Neocometes is morphologically closely allied to Typhlomys (see review in Carleton and Musser, 1984 ).
Subfamily Platacanthomyinae Alston, 1876 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1876:81 . COMMENTS: Diagnosis, general characteristics, and natural history provided by Carleton and Musser (1984) , who also referenced changes in allocation of subfamily from Myoxidae to Muridae , and explained why platacanthomyines are not dormice. Closest relatives of Platacanthomys and Typhlomys are two species of Neocometes from European Miocene ( Carleton and Musser, 1984 ), and a third species from Lower Miocene in N Thailand ( Mein et al., 1990 ). " Platacanthomys and Typhlomys , although chracterized by many specialized features, appear to be relicts of an assemblage that is recognizable as platacanthomyine as far back as the early Miocene, a group that may have had its origins in some primitive and as yet unknown Eocene or Oligocene [muroid] stock, probably in Asia" ( Carleton and Musser, 1984:368 ).
Platacanthomys Blyth, 1859 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 28:288 . TYPE SPECIES: Platacanthomys lasiurus Blyth, 1859 .
Otomys tropicalis Thomas, 1902 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 10:314 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , west slope of Mt. Kenya , 3000 m . DISTRIBUTION: Irregular highland distribution in W Kenya , Uganda , Rwanda , Burundi , and bordering Zaire ; outlying populations on Mount Cameroon . SYNONYMS: burtoni , dollmani , elgonis, faradjius, ghigii, nubilus, ruberculus, vivax , vulcanicus. COMMENTS: Regarded as conspecific with O. irroratus by Bohmann (1952) and accordingly recognized in regional treatments ( Delany, 1975 ; Kingdon, 1974); however, others have maintained the southern African form irroratus as specifically distinct from eastern African tropicalis ( De Graaff, 1981 ; Meester et al., 1986 ; Misonne, 1974 ). Even so, the taxa herein assembled under tropicalis (after Misonne, 1974 ) remain a composite of two or more species, whose definition and range will require careful revisionary work, involving simultaneous attention to possible relationships with species-group taxa now lumped under O. typus (see next account).
Otomys maximus Roberts, 1924 . Ann. Transvaal Mus., 10:70 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zambia , Machile River, a northern tributary of the Zambesi . DISTRIBUTION: S Angola , SW Zambia , Okavango region of Botswana , and Caprivi Strip of Namibia . SYNONYMS: cuanzensis , dovisi. COMMENTS: Described as a subspecies of irroratus and later elevated by Roberts (1951) to specific level. Viewed as a subspecies of O. angoniensis by Davis (1974), and so ranked in many faunal treatises (e.g., Meester et al., 1986 ; Misonne, 1974 ), or continued as a distinct species ( Smithers, 1983 ; Swanepoel et al., 1980 ), which leaves the matter of their synonymy as inconclusive to date.
Otomys sloggetti Thomas, 1902 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 10:311 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape Province , Deelfontein, north of Richmond . DISTRIBUTION: E Cape Province, Lesotho , and NW Natal, South Africa ( Lynch and Watson, 1992 ). SYNONYMS: basuticus, jeppei, robertsi , turneri . COMMENTS: A species with many primitive dental traits, viewed as closely related to O. unisulcatus ( Bohmann, 1952 ; Roberts, 1951 ; Thomas, 1918b ). Karyotypic and genetic data supplied by Contrafatto et al. (1992b) .
Otomys saundersiae Roberts, 1929 . Ann. Transvaal Mus., 13:115 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape Province , Grahamstown . DISTRIBUTION: Isolated populations in SW Cape Province and in E Cape to S Orange Free State and Lesotho . SYNONYMS: karoensis . COMMENTS: Named as a subspecies of tugelensis (= O. angoniensis ) by Roberts and later (1951) raised by him to full species.
Otomys laminatus Thomas and Schwann, 1905 . Abst. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1905(18):23 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Natal, Zululand, Nkandhla, Sibudeni, 1050 m . DISTRIBUTION: Discontinuous in South Africa , from SE Transvaal, parts of Natal and Transkei, to SW Cape Province ; also Swaziland . SYNONYMS: fannini, mariepsi, pondoensis, silberbaueri . COMMENTS: A species with a highly derived molar pattern, believed to intergrade with O. irroratus by Petter (1982) but retained as a species in recent faunal studies ( De Graaff, 1981 ; Meester et al., 1986 ; Smithers, 1983 ). Designated as the type of Lamotomys , a taxon employed as a subgenus of Otomys by Thomas (1918b) and as a genus by Roberts (1951) .
Otomys occidentalis Dieterlen and Van der Straeten, 1992 . Boon. Zool. Beitr., 43:386 . TYPE LOCALITY: SE Nigeria , Gotel Mtns, Chappal Waddi . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from the type locality and Mt. Oku in W Cameroon . COMMENTS: Closely related to populations in mountains of E Africa ( Dieterlen and Van der Straeten, 1992 ).
Parotomys littledalei Thomas, 1918 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 2:205 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape Province , Bushmanland, Kenhardt, Tuin . DISTRIBUTION: C and NW Cape Province , South Africa , to S and W Namibia . SYNONYMS: molopensis, namibensis. COMMENTS: Type species of Liotomys , named as a subgenus of Parotomys by Thomas (1918b) and viewed as a genus by Roberts (1951) .
Otomys typus Heuglin, 1877 . Reise in Nordost-Afrika, 2:77 . TYPE LOCALITY: Abyssinia (= Ethiopia ), Shoa . DISTRIBUTION: Disjunct occurrence at high elevations in E Africa, from Ethiopian highlands south through Uganda and W Kenya , to the Nyika Plateau of N Malawi and adjacent Zambia and to the Uzungwe Mnts of C Tanzania . SYNONYMS: dartmouthi , degeni , fortior , giloensis, helleri , jacksoni , malkensis, malleus, orestes , percivali , thomasi , squalus, uzungwensis , zinki . COMMENTS: Dieterlen (1968) and Petter (1982) viewed typus as another variant of a highly polymorphic O. irroratus , a conclusion which seems at odds with their morphological discrimination as presented elsewhere (e.g., Ansell, 1978 ; Bohmann, 1952 ; Kingdon, 1974; Misonne, 1974 ). The list of synonyms observes the classifications of Bohmann (1952) and Misonne (1974) . Their conspecific stature is highly suspect and invites rigorous specimen-based corroboration that also addresses possible relationships to certain forms masquerading under tropicalis . The occurrence of greater species endemism thoughout the isolated East African highlands and volcanoes deserves more serious consideration than it has received to date.
Otomys unisulcatus F. Cuvier, 1829 . In E. Geoffroy and F. Cuvier, Hist. Nat. Mammifères, pt. 3, 6(60):1 -2 "Otomys cafre". TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape Province , SW Karroo, Matjiesfontein, SW of Laingsburg (as designated by Roberts, 1946:318 ) . DISTRIBUTION: NW Cape Province , through the Great and Little Karroo, to E Cape Province , South Africa . SYNONYMS: albaniensis, bergensis, broomi , grantii. COMMENTS: A species having a relictual distribution and exhibiting many traits interpreted as plesiomorphic for the subfamily (e.g., Bohmann, 1952 ). Genetic distance data reported by Taylor et al. (1989) suggest the inclusion of unisulcatus with species of Parotomys , an intriguing possibility that deserves substantiation with a broader taxonomic sampling. Allozymic variation unappreciable over species range and questions validity of subspecific divisions (see Van Dyk et al., 1991 ).
Parotomys brantsii (A. Smith, 1834) . S. Afr. Quart. J., Ser. 2, 2: 150 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape Province , Little Namaqualand, "toward the mouth of the Orange River." DISTRIBUTION: C and NW Cape Province , South Africa , to SW Botswana and SE Namibia . SYNONYMS: deserti , luteolus , pallida , rufifrons . COMMENTS: Although Port Nolloth, as restricted by Thomas and Schwann (1904:178) , is usually cited as the type locality of P. brantsii (e.g., Ellerman et al., 1953; Meester et al., 1986 ), a careful reading of Thomas and Schwann suggests that they had actually associated one of Smith's cotypes with a series collected at Klipfontein, a place some 50 miles inland from Port Nolloth. The notion that the type locality was "restricted" to Port Nolloth apparently stems from an inadvertent indication in Roberts (1951) . A future revisor of the species should clarify this matter.
Parotomys Thomas, 1918 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 2:204 . TYPE SPECIES: Euryotis brantsii A. Smith, 1834 . SYNONYMS: Liotomys . COMMENTS: Bohmann (1952) allocated Parotomys as another synonym of an all-inclusive genus Otomys . Maintained as a separate genus by Ellerman (1941) and in most later systematic accounts (Ellerman et al., 1953; Misonne, 1974 ; De Graaff, 1981 ; Meester et al., 1986 ). Roberts (1951) also elevated Liotomys to generic rank. See comments under subfamily.
Subfamily Otomyinae Thomas, 1897 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1896:1017 [1897]. COMMENTS: Morphologically, a strongly circumscribed group of species indigenous to Subsaharan Africa; early on ranked as a subfamily of Muridae sensu stricto ( Miller and Gidley, 1918 ; Simpson, 1945 ), later as a subfamily of Cricetidae ( Misonne, 1974 ) or Nesomyidae ( Chaline et al., 1977 ; Lavocat, 1978 ). Paleontological evidence and anatomical considerations have reopened the question of their phyletic origin from African murines, especially arvicanthine forms ( Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; Pocock, 1976 ), although the phylogenetic significance of the annectant fossil genus (Euryotomys Pocock, 1976 ), as a murid or cricetid, has been recently disputed (see Denys et al., 1987 ). Number of genera recognized has varied from five ( Roberts, 1951 ) to three ( Thomas, 1918b ; Pocock, 1976 ) to one ( Bohmann, 1952 ), usually just the two listed here ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Ellerman et al., 1953; Misonne, 1974 ; De Graaff, 1981 ; Meester et al., 1986 ; Smithers, 1983 ). The diverse generic arrangements principally reflect the emphasis on dentition versus bullar development as a diagnostic key. Integration of a more heterogeneous information base, such as the allozymic survey initiated by Taylor et al. (1989) , would better illuminate phylogenetic relationships and perhaps stabilize our generic classification. Morphological features described by Bernard et al. (1990) , Bohmann (1952) , Perrin and Curtis (1980) , and Tullberg (1899) . Few multispecies surveys of chromosomes and proteins undertaken to date; available information covered by Robinson and Elder (1987) and Taylor et al. (1989) .
Hypogeomys antimena A. Grandidier, 1869 . Rev. Mag. Zool. Paris, ser. 2, 21:339 . TYPE LOCALITY: Madagascar , Toliara Prov. , between the banks of the Tsiribihina and Andranomena rivers .

DISTRIBUTION: Dryer regions of W and S Madagascar , including deciduous forest and open savannah. SYNONYMS: occidentalis .
Nesomys rufus Peters, 1870 . Sitb. Ges. Naturf. Fr. Berlin , p. 55 . TYPE LOCALITY: Madagascar , Antsiranana Prov. , Vohima . DISTRIBUTION: Broadly distributed in N and E forest ( audeberti and rufus ), and one locality in WC Madagascar ( lambertoni ). SYNONYMS: audeberti , lambertoni . COMMENTS: Ellerman (1941 , 1949a ) listed audeberti and lambertoni as species as described, but Petter (1972c , 1975a ) arranged them as subspecies of N. rufus . Carleton and Schmidt (1990) indicated that each will stand as a species upon revision.
Macrotarsomys ingens Petter, 1959 . Mammalia, 23:140 . TYPE LOCALITY: Madagascar , Mahajanga Prov. , Ankarafantsika Reserve, near Ampijoroa . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Occurs sympatrically with M. bastardi .
Nesomys Peters, 1870 . Sitzb. Ges. Naturf. Fr. Berlin , p. 54 . TYPE SPECIES: Nesomys rufus Peters, 1870 . SYNONYMS: Hallomys . COMMENTS: Major (1897) synonymized Jentink's (1879) Hallomys (type species = H. audeberti ) under Nesomys and allocated the genus to the Cricetinae .
Macrotarsomys Milne-Edwards and G. Grandidier, 1898 . Bull. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, ser. 1, 4:179 . TYPE SPECIES: Macrotarsomys bastardi Milne Edwards and G. Grandidier, 1898 . COMMENTS: Retained within Cricetinae by Ellerman (1941) . Lavocat (1978) and Chaline et al. (1977) aligned Macrotarsomys with the Miocene Kenyan fossil Protarsomys , a relationship questioned by Carleton and Schmidt (1990) .
Otomys anchietae Bocage, 1882 . J. Sci. Acad. Lisbon , 9:26 . TYPE LOCALITY: Angola , Huila, Caconda . DISTRIBUTION: Isolated segments in C Angola , SW Tanzania , N Malawi , and W Kenya . SYNONYMS: barbouri , lacustris . COMMENTS: Type species of Anchotomys , employed as a subgenus of Otomys by Thomas (1918b) . Believed to be closely related to O. irroratus ( Bohmann, 1952 ) , if not conspecific with it ( Petter, 1982 ). Dieterlen and Van der Straeten (1992) treated barbouri and lacustris as separate species.
Otomys denti Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:142 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , east slope of Mount Ruwenzori, Mubuku Valley, 6000 ft (as restricted by Moreau et al., 1946:420 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Intermittently found in EC Africa, from Mt. Ruwenzori, Uganda , through the Virunga volcanoes, to the Nyika Plateau of N Malawi and Zambia and to the Usambara and Uluguru mountains, EC Tanzania . SYNONYMS: kempi , sungae. COMMENTS: The form kempi has been treated as a distinct species (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ; Thomas, 1918b ); reduced to subspecific rank by Bohmann (1952) and so observed currently ( Delany, 1975 ; Misonne, 1974 ).
Otomys angoniensis Wroughton, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:274 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malawi , Misuku Range, Matipa Forest, 7000 ft (as refined by Ansell and Dowsett, 1991 ) . DISTRIBUTION: SE savannah and grasslands, from S Kenya to NE Cape Province , South Africa . SYNONYMS: canescens , divinorum, elassodon, mashona , nyikae , pretoriae, rowleyi , sabiensis, tugelensis . COMMENTS: Confused under O. irroratus by Bohmann (1952) ; morphological and karyotypic differences support their separate specific status (Davis, 1962; Matthey, 1964 ; Misonne, 1974 ). The form maximus (see account below) is viewed by some as a subspecies of O. angoniensis . See Bronner and Meester (1988 , Mammalian Species, 306).
Otomys F. Cuvier, 1824 . Dents des Mammifères, p. 255 . TYPE SPECIES: Euryotis irrorata Brants, 1827 . SYNONYMS: Anchotomys , Euryotis , Lamotomys , Metotomys , Myotomys , Oreinomys , Oreomys , Palaeotomys . COMMENTS: Bohmann (1952) included all otomyine species in Otomys , but most classifications have accorded the large-bullar forms seperate generic status as Parotomys (see below). Other synonyms have been infrequently treated as genera, namely Myotomys, including unisulcatus and sloggetti (see Thomas, 1918b ; Pocock, 1976 ), and Lamotomys, including laminatus (see Roberts, 1951 ). Oldest known fossil Otomys species date from late Pliocene (2-3 mya) in South Africa and from early Pleistocene (1-2 mya) in East Africa (see Denys, 1989).
Otomys irroratus (Brants, 1827) . Het Geslacht der Muizen, p. 94 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape Province , Cape Town district, near Constantia (as fixed by A. Smith, 1834:149) . DISTRIBUTION: Mesic savannah and grasslands of southern Africa: S Cape Province to C Transvaal, South Africa ; disjunct populations in W South Africa and in E Zimbabwe and contiguous Mozambique . SYNONYMS: auratus , bisulcatus , capensis , coenosus , cupreoides, cupreus , natalensis , obscura , orientalis , randensis, typicus . COMMENTS: Bohmann (1952) established a broad, highly polymorphic definition of O. irroratus , then including among his 23 subspecies angoniensis and maximus (see those accounts). Presumably excepting angoniensis and maximus, Dieterlen (1968) and Petter (1982) further enlarged Bohmann's concept of irroratus to subsume the following forms here (and elsewhere) treated as separate species (see individual accounts): anchietae , laminatus , tropicalis , and typus . Although followed to a greater or lesser extent (e.g., Delany, 1975 ; Kingdon, 1974), such an inclusive species construct is disputed by others who restrict O. irroratus proper to southern Africa (e.g., Meester et al., 1986 ; Misonne, 1974 ). G-banded comparisons reveal a karyotype that is highly derived ( Robinson and Elder, 1987 ). Cytogenetic variation extensive among South African population samples ( Contrafatto et al., 1992a ). See Bronner et al. (1988, Mammalian Species, 308).
Mystromys albicaudatus (A. Smith, 1834) . S Afr. Quart. J., 2:148 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Africa, E Cape Province , Albany Dist . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to southern Africa: Cape Prov. , W and N Natal, Orange Free State , and SW and S Transvaal ( South Africa ), and Swaziland ; see map in Skinner and Smithers (1990:297) . SYNONYMS: albipes , fumosus , lanuginosus (see Meester et al., 1986 ). COMMENTS: Closest phylogenetic relatives are Mystromys hausleitneri , M. pocockei , and Proodontomys cookei , all extinct and represented by fossils from Pliocene-Pleistocene australopithecine sites in the Transvaal of South Africa ( Denys, 1991 ; Pocock, 1987 ).
Brachyuromys betsileoensis (Bartlett, 1880) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1879:770 [1880]. TYPE LOCALITY: Madagascar , "S.E. Betsileo.” DISTRIBUTION: Madagascar : Central plateau and its eastern fringes. COMMENTS: Described as a species of Nesomys but referred to Brachyuromys by Major (1896) ; occurs sympatrically with B. ramirohitra .
Brachytarsomys albicauda Günther, 1875 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1875:80 . TYPE LOCALITY: Madagascar , between "Tamatave and Morondava." DISTRIBUTION: E Madagascar rain forest at middle elevations. SYNONYMS: villosa . COMMENTS: The indeterminate nature of Günther's (1875) type locality might be restricted with archival research since the species occurs only in the east. Carleton and Schmidt (1990) suggested that villosa , named as a subspecies by F. Petter (1962a) based on a zoo specimen, is a distinct species; its geographic occurrence is unknown.
Subfamily Nesomyinae Major, 1897 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1897:718 . SYNONYMS: Brachytarsomyes, Brachyuromyes, Eliuri, Gymnuromyinae . COMMENTS: Group exceedingly diverse morphologically, defying an unambiguous diagnosis and questioning their monophyletic origin (see discussion in Carleton and Musser, 1984 ). Proponents of a single ancestral origin have usually arranged nesomyines as a subfamily of Cricetidae (e.g., Miller and Gidley, 1918 ; Simpson, 1945 ) or as a subfamily within a broadly defined family Nesomyidae , which includes other archaic groups like cricetomyines, tachyoryctines, and Mystromys ( Chaline et al., 1977 ; Lavocat, 1978 ). Ellerman (1941 , 1949a ) argued that nesomyines are polyphyletic and dispersed the seven genera among four subfamilies of Muridae sensu lato, as reflected in the family-group synonyms all named by Ellerman (1941) . Lavocat (1978) viewed Protarsomys , lower Miocene of Kenya , as close to the ancestry of Malagasy Nesomyinae , and Chaline et al. (1977) placed the Miocene fossil in synonymy under extant Macrotarsomys . Carleton and Schmidt (1990) disputed this relationship and generic equivalence; nesomyines otherwise known only from the Holocene of Madagascar . Ellerman (1949a) provided the most valuable synopsis of nesomyine taxa and set forth the basic species-level classification currently recognized; taxonomy updated by Petter (1972c , 1975a ). Locality data, geographic ranges, and type localities of named forms summarized by Carleton and Schmidt (1990) . Revisionary and ecological studies required for all genera.
Brachyuromys Major, 1896 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:322 . TYPE SPECIES: Brachyuromys ramirohitra Major, 1896 . COMMENTS: Ellerman (1941) allied Brachyuromys as a tribe within Tachoryctinae, an affinity earlier considered plausible by Major (1897) .
Brachytarsomys Günther, 1875 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1875:79 . TYPE SPECIES: Brachytarsomys albicauda Günther, 1875 . COMMENTS: The incipient prismatic condition of the dentition persuaded Ellerman (1941) to classify Brachytarsomys as a primitive microtine.
Gymnuromys roberti Major, 1896 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:324 . TYPE LOCALITY: Madagascar , Fianarantsoa Prov. , Ampitambe forest . DISTRIBUTION: E Madagascar rain forest, 500 to 950 m . COMMENTS: Some have voiced concern that populations of G. roberti are being supplanted by introduced Rattus (summary in Carleton and Schmidt, 1990 ).

SYNONYMS: fuliginosus , henseli, orycter, subterraneus . COMMENTS: Member of Thaptomys , usually segregated as a subgenus of Akodon (Cabrera, 1961; Massoia, 1963a ) though Reig (1978 , 1987) considered Thaptomys a full synonym of Akodon sensu stricto. Includes subterraneus , the type of Thaptomys (see Massoia, 1963a ).

Akodon mimus (Thomas, 1901) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 7:183 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., Limbane, 2600 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Andean slopes of SE Peru to WC Bolivia . COMMENTS: Type species of Microxus , a taxon arranged either as a subgenus of Akodon (Cabrera, 1961) , as a distinct akodontine genus ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Reig, 1987; Thomas, 1916c ), or as a synonym of the oxymycterine genus Abrothrix ( Hershkovitz, 1966c ) . Preliminary electrophoretic evidence indicates that mimus is phyletically closer to species of Akodon sensu stricto than to those of Bolomys or Chroeomys (see Patton et al., 1989; Smith and Patton, 1991 ). Also see remarks under A. bogotensis.
Akodon mollis Thomas, 1894 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:363 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Piura Dept., Tumbes . DISTRIBUTION: High Andes of Ecuador to NC Peru . SYNONYMS: altorum, fulvescens . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . See remarks under A. fumeus .

DISTRIBUTION: Andes of Rio Negro Prov., Argentina . COMMENTS: Subgenus Abrothrix . Reig (1987) questioned the subgeneric assignment as well as the validity of this form.
Akodon longipilis (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Coquimbo Prov. , Coquimbo . DISTRIBUTION: C to S Chile and Argentina . SYNONYMS: angustus , apta, brachytarsus, castanea , francei, fusco-ater, hirta , melampus, modestior, moerens, nubila, porcinus, suffusa. COMMENTS: Type species of Abrothrix , typically ranked as a subgenus of Akodon (Cabrera, 1961; Ellerman, 1941 ; Reig, 1978 , 1987), occasionally as a genus ( Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ), or with Microxus as a synonym ( Hershkovitz, 1966c ). See Reig (1987) for a review of treatment of Abrothrix and its specific contents. Species closely related to, perhaps conspecific with sanborni (see Osgood, 1943 ; Pine et al., 1979 ); also see A. lanosus . Pearson (1984) assigned Chelemys angustus to synonymy with A. longipilis ; other synonyms follow Osgood (1943) .
Akodon orophilus Osgood, 1913 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:98 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Amazonas Dept., Leimabamba, Alto Utcubamba, 2400 m . DISTRIBUTION: Mountains of N Peru . SYNONYMS: orientalis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Although initially described as a subspecies of A. mollis, Osgood (1943: 197) later removed orophilus as a distinct species, at which rank it has since remained (Cabrera, 1961; Reig, 1987). Level of differentiation from A. torques , which Cabrera (1961) arranged as a subspecies of A. orophilus , uncertain.
Akodon olivaceus (Waterhouse, 1837) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Chile , Aconcagua Prov., Valparaiso .

COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Yaftez et al. (1979) arranged xanthorhinus and canescens as subspecies of A. olivaceus ; Patterson et al. (1984) presented distributional and morphological arguments that sustain their specific distinction. Listing of Phillipi's numerous epithets follows Osgood (1943) .

DISTRIBUTION: High altipiano of C Peru ( Puno ), through W Bolivia , to NW Argentina . SYNONYMS: caenosus , lutescens , polius . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Karyologic and morphometric variation presented, as A. caenosus , by Barquez et al. (1980) . In their revision of the boliviensis group, Myers et al. (1990) referred caenosus , maintained as a species by Cabrera (1961), and lutescens , classified as a subspecies of A. andinus by Cabrera (1961), to subspecies of A. puer (also see Vitullo et al., 1986 ). Hershkovitz (1990c) listed both caenosus and lutescens as species affiliated with A. boliviensis .

TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Puno Dept., Pichu-Pichun, 14,000 ft (location clarified by Myers et al., 1990:49 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Altipiano of SE Peru and NC Bolivia . SYNONYMS: pacificus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Karyology and geographic variation evaluated by Myers et al. (1990) , who more narrowly defined the morphological and distributional boundaries of A. boliviensis , excluding spegazzinii and subfuscus , forms which had been arranged as subspecies (e.g., Cabrera, 1961). Southern range limits poorly understood (see Myers et al., 1990 ).

COMMENTS: Subgenus Microxus . As noted by Patton et al. (1989), generic-level representation of the divergence of Microxus from Akodon is more often based on traits of the species bogotensis , not the type species of Microxus (= Oxymycterus mimus ). The status of bogotensis , together with that of latebricola , deserves reconsideration with respect to A. mimus (see comments therein) and other Akodon . Also see Reig (1987) and Voss and Linzey (1981) .
Akodon lindberghi Hershkovitz, 1990 . Fieldiana Zool., New Ser., 57:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , Distrito Federal, 20 km NW Brasilia, Parque Nacional de Brasilia, Matosa, 1100 m . DISTRIBUTION: Cerrado habitat of the Parque Nacional de Brasilia. COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Morphology, karyotype, and habitat described by Hershkovitz (1990c) , who assigned the species to the A. boliviensis species group. Hershkovitz (1990c) also discussed the nomen nudum Plectomys paludicola and its possible equivalence to the species A. lindberghi .

COMMENTS: Variably placed with Abrothrix , usually as a subgenus (Cabrera, 1961; Reig, 1987), or with Akodon sensu stricto ( Gardner and Patton, 1976 ).
Akodon juninensis Myers, Patton, and Smith, 1990 . Mise. Pubi. Mus. Zool., Univ. Michigan , 177:41 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peru , Junin Dept., 22 km (by road) N La Oroya (at junction of Hwy 3 to Junin and Hwy 20 to Tarma), 4040 m . DISTRIBUTION: E and W Andean slopes, above 2700 m , of C Peru , south along western slopes to Dept. Ayacucho . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon .

SYNONYMS: langguthi. COMMENTS: Type species of Deltamys , usually treated as a subgenus of Akodon (e.g., Cabrera, 1961; Reig, 1987), although Massoia (1980b) accorded the taxon generic status.
Akodon lanosus (Thomas, 1897) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 20:218 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Tierra del Fuego Prov. , Bahia Monteith, Straits of Magellan . DISTRIBUTION: Southernmost Chile and Argentina . COMMENTS: Subgenus Abrothrix . Relegated to a subspecies of A. longipilis by Mann (1978) but others have affirmed its specific status ( Osgood, 1943 ; Yanez et al., 1978 ). Earlier associated with Microxus (e.g., Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ) but later allocated to subgenus Abrothrix of Akodon ( Osgood, 1943 ; Reig, 1987).
Aepeomys Thomas, 1898 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 1:452 . TYPE SPECIES: Oryzomys lugens Thomas, 1896 . COMMENTS: Thomasomyine. Synonymized under Thomasomys by Osgood (1933c) and so followed by Ellerman (1941) and Cabrera (1961); generic status maintained by Gyldenstolpe (1932) and Gardner and Patton (1976) . Level of recognition of Aepeomys requires phylogentic investigation involving other thomasomyines.

Tachyoryctes splendens (Rüppell, 1835) . Neue wirbelt. Fauna Abyssin. Gehörig., Säugeth., 1:36 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Dembea Prov, Gondar . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia ( 500-3900 m ; Rupp, 1980 ), Somalia , and NW Kenya ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: canicaudus , cheesmani , gallarum, ibeanus , omensis, pontifex, somalicus . COMMENTS: Yalden et al. (1976) claimed that the synonyms (except for ibeanus ) listed here clearly apply to one species. Osgood (1936) , however, noted that two species, splendens and cheesmani , could be distinguished among the Ethiopian samples he examined. We include ibeanus because it is geographically close to the range of T. splendens and was originally described as a subspecies of that species (see Allen, 1939 ). Hollister (1919) identified series from SE Kenya as T. ibeanus .
Tachyoryctes ruddi Thomas, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:547 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Mt. Elgon, Kirui, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: SW Kenya (vicinity of Mt. Elgon) and SE Uganda . SYNONYMS: badius . COMMENTS: Hollister (1919) commented on pelage traits.

COMMENTS: Second only to Murinae in generic and specific diversity. Priority of familygroup name Sigmodontinae set forth by Hershkovitz (1966b) and Reig (1980). Taxonomic and nomenclatural histories of many forms compiled by Tate (1932a-h). State-of-the-art alpha-level classifications presented by Miller (1924) , Gyldenstolpe (1932) , Ellerman (1941) , Hall and Kelson (1959) , Cabrera (1961), and Hall (1981) . The studies of Carleton (1980) , Gardner and Patton (1976) , Hershkovitz (1962 , 1966c ), Hooper and Musser (1964a) , and Reig (1980, 1984, 1987) contain information on higher-level relationships and classificatory arrangements. For an overview of phylogenetic diversification and biogeography of Sigmodontinae , see Hershkovitz (1966b) and Reig (1984 , 1986); for a paleontological background, see Baskin (1986) , Martin (1980) , Marshall (1979) , Reig (1978) , and Slaughter and Ubelaker (1984) . Sigmodontine genera have been informally or formally grouped into tribes (see Carleton and Musser, 1989 ; Hershkovitz, 1966c ; and Reig, 1980, 1984); however, convincing evidence of monophyly has been mustered for only one of these tribal constructs (see Voss, 1988 ). The tribal affiliations, cited here in their informal adjectival construction, basically conform to Reig (1980, 1984), except that we maintain the thomasomyines (= Aepeomys , Delomys , Phaenomys , Rhagomys , Rhipidomys , Thomasomys, and Wilfredomys) as distinct from the oryzomyines (see Thomas, 1906d , 1917c ; Hershkovitz, 1966c ; Carleton and Musser, 1989 ).
Abrawayaomys Cunha and Cruz, 1979 . Bol. Mus. Biol. Prof. Mello-Leitao Zool., 96:2 . TYPE SPECIES: Abrawayaomys ruschii Cunha and Cruz, 1979 . COMMENTS: Diagnostic traits of the new genus seem to combine aspects of Neacomys , Oryzomys , and Akodon , and Reig (1987) acknowledged the enigmatic affinities of Abrawayaomys as Sigmodontinae incertae sedis. Certain cranial features of Abrawayaomys suggest an archaic thomasomyine, perhaps distantly related to other thomasomyine genera of SE Brazil (e.g., see comment under Delomys ).

COMMENTS: Formerly ranked as a subspecies of A. lugens (Cabrera, 1961) . Chromosomal morphology highly divergent among thomasomyines reported by Gardner and Patton (1976) , who listed it as a species without explanation.
Akodon aerosus Thomas, 1913 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 11:406 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ecuador , Tungurahua Prov. , upper Rio Pastaza , Mirador, 1500 m . DISTRIBUTION: SE Ecuador , E Peru , and NW Bolivia . SYNONYMS: baliolus. COMMENTS: Type species of Chalcomys , usually placed as a synonym of the subgenus Akodon (Cabrera, 1961; Reig, 1987). Formerly included as a subspecies of A. urichi by Cabrera (1961), but Gardner and Patton (1976) , noting the pronounced difference in diploid number, listed the two as separate species. Probably more than one species yet masquerades under the name of A. aerosus (see Patton et al., 1990).
Akodon albiventer Thomas, 1897 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 20:217 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Salta Prov. , Bajo Rio Cachi . DISTRIBUTION: SE Peru , through WC Bolivia , to N Argentina and Chile . SYNONYMS: berlepschii. COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Sometimes referenced as a member of Bolomys ( Bianchi et al., 1971 ; Gardner and Patton, 1976 ), but its inclusion, together with berlepschii, within Akodon proper is more strongly supported ( Pine et al., 1979 ; Reig, 1987).

Akodon Meyen, 1833 . Verhandl. Kais. Leop.-Carol. Akad. Wiss., 16(2):599 . TYPE SPECIES: Akodon boliviensis Meyen, 1833 . SYNONYMS: Abrothrix , Chalcomys , Deltamys , Hypsimys , Microxus , Thaptomys . COMMENTS: The morphotypical akodontine genus stands at the nexus of a host of specific- and generic-level taxonomic problems. To review all classificatory variations here would be more confusing than enlightening; suffice it to say that the nomenclatural history of the following genus-group taxa has been variously intertwined with that of Akodon : Abrothrix , Bolomys, Chalcomys , Chroeomys , Deltamys , Hypsimys , Microxus , Thalpomys , and Thaptomys (especially see Cabrera, 1961; Ellerman, 1941 ; Gyldenstolpe, 1932 ; Reig, 1984 , 1987; Tate, 1932#; Thomas, 1916c ). Comprehension of akodont systematics has been hindered by lack of explicit specimen documentation, careful character analyses, and a phylogenetic context, which in turn erodes decisions about the ranking of genus-group taxa. Fortunately, renewed interest in basic revisionary study will render the alpha systematics of akodonts less imposing (see Apfelbaum and Reig, 1989 ; Hershkovitz, 1990«, c; Myers, 1989; Myers et al., 1990 ; Patton et al., 1989; Reig, 1987). See accounts of Bolomys, Chroeomys, and Thalpomys for history and arguments on their generic status.
Akodon azarae (Fischer, 1829) . Synopsis Mamm., p. 325 . TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Entre Rios Prov. , about 30°30'S latitude between the Uruguay and Parana Rivers . DISTRIBUTION: NE Argentina , southernmost Bolivia , Paraguay , Uruguay , and extreme S Brazil . SYNONYMS: arenicola , bibianae, hunteri . COMMENTS: Subgenus Akodon . Olrog and Lucero (1981) maintained arenicola as a species distinct from A. azarae , but karyotypic and other data support their union ( Vitullo et al., 1986 ; Ximenez et al., 1972 ).
Tachyoryctes Rüppell, 1835 . Neue wirbelth. Fauna Abyssin. Gehörig., Säugeth., 1:35 , footnote. TYPE SPECIES: Bathyergus splendens Rüppell, 1835 . SYNONYMS: Chrysomys . COMMENTS: Hollister (1919:40) listed eight species of Tachyoryctes , noting that "all have constant characters of differentiation, and intergradation between any two of them is not indicated by this material," and speculated that the "numerous forms will doubtlessly be connected by complete chains of intergrades and the final monographer of the genus will be obliged to reduce many of the named forms to the rank of subspecies." Allen (1939) and Ellerman (1941) listed 14 species of Tachyoryctes , but these were reduced to T. macrocephalus and T. splendens by Misonne (1974) who was followed by Corbet and Hill (1991) . Of the twenty forms described, Rahm (1980) considered about 16 of them to be valid subspecies of T. splendens. This change from 14 to 2 species was not based on careful analyses of morphological variation characterizing the named forms. Aside from Bekele's (1986) inconclusive univariate analyses of craniometric data from samples of Tachyoryctes, no assessment of morphological variation in the genus is available in context of a systematic revision. Until such a study provides documentation and definition of specific limits and their geographic distributions, we return to a modifed treatment of the arrangement by Allen (1939) and Ellerman (1941) , which reflects the diagnostic information now available.

Subfamily Rhizomyinae Winge, 1887 . E Museo Lundii, 1:109 . SYNONYMS: Tachyoryctinae. COMMENTS: Diagnosed and reviewed by Carleton and Musser (1984) and Flynn (1990) , who also summarized relationships of extant and extinct genera in form of a cladogram. Flynn treated the group as a separate family and utilized Tachyoryctinae for Tachyoryctes and Rhizomyinae for Rhizomys and Cannomys ; in our scheme these two groups would be treated as tribes.

Tateomys Musser, 1969 . Am. Mus. Novit., 2384:2 . TYPE SPECIES: Tateomys rhinogradoides Musser, 1969 . COMMENTS: Originally, and incorrectly, linked to the " Rattus chrysocomus group " by Musser (1969b) , but morphological, spermatozoal, and ecological characteristics clearly united Tateomys and the other Sulawesian shrew rat Melasmothrix in the same monophyletic group to the exclusion of either Rattus , Bunomys , or any other Sulawesian endemic ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Musser, 1982c ). Listed as part of the Sulawesi Old Endemics by Musser (1981c) .
Taeromys callitrichus (Jentink, 1878) . Notes Leyden Mus., p. 12 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , NE Sulawesi , Kakas . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi : recorded from a few places on the NE peninsula, in the central core, and on the SE peninsula ( Musser, 1970d ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: jentinki , maculipilis , microbullatus . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (197CW). Most closely related to T. arcuatus .

DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi : recorded from throughout island ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). COMMENTS: Recorded from SW peninsula only by subfossil fragment ( Musser, 1984 ), but from elsewhere by extant specimens. Morphologically distant from other species in the genus ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).

COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1971d) .
Tarsomys Mearns, 1905 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 28:453 . TYPE SPECIES: Tarsomys apoensis Mearns, 1905 . COMMENTS: Revised by Musser and Heaney (1992) who recorded the history of the incorrect inclusion of Tarsomys in Rattus , and placed the genus in the group of Philippine New Endemics, although its closest relative has yet to be determined.
Thallomys nigricauda Thomas, 1882 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1882:266 . TYPE LOCALITY: Namibia , Great Namaqualand, Hountop (= Hudup or Hutop) River, west of Gibeon ( Meester et al., 1986 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Angola , Namibia , N Cape Prov. of South Africa , Botswana , and SE Zamibia; north and eastern limits unknown. SYNONYMS: bradfieldi, damarensis , davisi , herero , kalaharicus, leuconoe , molopensis, nitela , quissamae, robertsi . COMMENTS: T. nigricauda and T. paedulcus are now recognized as occurring in the Southern African Subregion by Skinner and Smithers (1990) , who also summarized some of the chromosomal, morphological, and ecological distinctions between the two species. They also suggested that herero and leuconoe may represent samples of T. paedulcus , but the holotypes are examples of T. nigricauda . Morphological and geographic definitions of T. nigricauda are unsatisfactory. Appreciable geographic variation in body size, length of molar row, pelage coloration, and tail pilosity exists among samples and its significance will have to be assessed by critical systematic revision.
Tateomys rhinogradoides Musser, 1969 . Am. Mus. Novit., 2384:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Gunung Latimodjong, 2200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Known from the type locality, Gunung Tokala, and Gunung Nokilalaki at high elevations in upper montane rain forest in central core of Sulawesi .
Tateomys macrocercus Musser, 1982 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 174:64 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Gunung Nokilalaki, 7500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only between 6500 and 7500 ft in the upper montane rain forest on Gunung Nokilalaki, but probably occurs in other mountainous regions of at least C Sulawesi .
Thallomys loringi (Heller, 1909) . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 52:471 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Kenya , Lake Naivasha . DISTRIBUTION: Known only by specimens from E Kenya , and N and E Tanzania ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Originally described as a species of Thamnomys ( Heller, 1909 ) , then listed as a subspecies of Thallomys nigricauda ( Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ), and finally allocated to T. damarensis (here included in nigricauda ) as a subspecies ( Petter, 1973a ). T. loringi is morphologically and probably phylogenetically allied to T. nigricauda , but no critical documentation of its conspecificity with that species has ever been presented. Because T. loringi can be diagnosed by pelage and other distinctions, we list it as a species, a hypothesis that can be tested by careful systematic revision of the genus.
Thallomys Thomas, 1920 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 5:141 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus nigricauda Thomas, 1882 . COMMENTS: After being proposed as a genus by Thomas (1920), Thallomys was used in checklists (e.g., Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ) until Ellerman et al. (1953) united it with subgenus Aethomys of Rattus . Thallomys was reinstated by Lundholm (1955c) , who also suggested it was closely related to Thamnomys . Misonne (1969) pointed out that Thallomys has nothing to do with Rattus, and is most closely related to Tertiary european Parapodemus, an evaluation based on molar occlusal patterns. Although clearly unrelated to Rattus, Thallomy's phylogenetic position within the diversity of African murines is still unresolved. Early checklists and faunal accounts recognized several species ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Roberts, 1951 ), but for last 20-30 years, Thallomys has been either treated as monotypic (D. H. S. Davis, 1965; Meester et al., 1986 ; Misonne, 1974 ), or as containing at least two species ( Petter, 1973a ; Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). That considerable and significant morphological diversity exists in the genus has been acknowedged. D. H. S. Davis (1965), for example, recognized five groups of subspecies. Petter (1973a) clearly demonstrated that at least two species could be diagnosed. Regional faunal reports of southern African mammals discussed presence of two distinct kinds ( Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ; Smithers and Wilson, 1979 ). Meester et al. (1986) announced the need for revision of Thallomys, and that both morphological and chromosomal data suggested the presence of two species (see Gordon, 1987 ). We list four species. Our review is based on original descriptions of taxa, Roberts' (1951) useful monograph and other regional faunal reports, large collections of specimens, and holotypes . Gastric anatomy reported by Perrin (1986) .
Stochomys Thomas, 1926 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 17:176 . TYPE SPECIES: Dasymys longicaudatus Tullberg, 1893 . COMMENTS: Listed as a genus by Allen (1939) , but allocated to Rattus as a subgenus by Ellerman (1941) . D. H. S. Davis (1965) placed Stochomys in Aethomys as a subgenus, which reflected Thomas's (1915) early allocation of longicaudatus to subgenus Aethomys . Misonne (1969) and Rosevear (1969) , however, reinstated the generic position of Stochomys, correctly noting that it was distinctive and not closely related to Rattus. It has been phylogenetically associated with Dephomys (D. H. S. Davis, 1965; Misonne, 1969 ), but is unrelated to that genus, as reflected by morphometric analyses ( Van der Straeten, 1984 ), and analyses of qualitative traits. Features of pelage, skull, and dentition characterizing Stochomys are most similar to those found in species of Aethomys, and suggest the two to be members of the same monophyletic clade in which Stochomys is the high forest partner of Savanna Aethomys.
Stenomys ceramicus (Thomas, 1920) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 6:425 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Moluccas , Pulau Seram, Gunung Manusela, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to montane forests of Seram Isl. COMMENTS: Apparently morphologically related to the S. niobe complex of New Guinea . Originally described as a species of Nesorotnys ( Rümmler, 1938 ).
Stenomys niobe (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:327 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Angabunga River, Owgarra, 2750 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea , nearly all montane regions, including the Huon Peninsula (see map in Taylor et al., 1982:191 ). SYNONYMS: arfakiensis , arrogans , clarae, haymani, klossi , pococki , rufulus , stevensi. COMMENTS: Revised by Taylor et al. (1982) , who recognized two distinct subspecies, arrogans and niobe . Flannery (19906:241), however, noted that unpublished results from biochemical studies indicated that two species are present in what Taylor et al. (1982) defined as a single species, one at high altitudes, the other at lower altitudes. Chromosomal morphology presented by Dennis and Menzies (1978) . Phallic anatomy discussed by Lidicker (1968).
Stenomys vandeuseni (Taylor and Calaby, 1982) . In Taylor et al., Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 173:211 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Maneau Range, N slope Mt Dayman, Middle Camp, 1540 m . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Taylor and Calaby described vandeuseni as a subspecies of verecundus ( Taylor et al., 1982 ) , but its distinctive morphology and habitat indicate otherwise, as the describers even suggested, and as Flannery (19906:245) speculated. Stenomys verecundus occurs on Mt Dayman in rain forest at 700 m and is replaced at 1540 m in montane oak forest by S. vandeuseni , a relationship that is similar to the distributions of Leptomys elegans (rain forest) and L. ernstmayri (oak forest) on Mt Dayman.
Stenomys richardsoni (Tate, 1949) . Am. Mus. Novit., 1421:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, near Lake Habbema, 3225 m .

DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Vogelkop and Weyland Range of Irian Jaya, Central Cordillera east of 141 ° to easternmost Papua New Guinea ; 150 to 2750 m (see map in Taylor et al., 1982:204 ). SYNONYMS: mollis , tomba, unicolor . COMMENTS: Revised by Taylor et al. (1982) , who recognized three distinct subspecies— mollis , unicolor , and verecundus . Chromosomal morphology discussed by Dennis and Menzies (1978) .
Stenomys Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:507 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus verecundus Thomas, 1904 . SYNONYMS: Nesoromys . COMMENTS: Flannery (1990b) provided photographs of animals along with distributional and biological summaries of New Guinea species. Rümmler (1938) united Nesoromys with Stenomys .

DISTRIBUTION: Tropical evergreen forest; recorded from Togo , S Nigeria , Central African Republic , Cameroon , Gabon , Zaire , and Uganda . SYNONYMS: hypoleucus (Pucheran, 1855, not Sundevall), ituricus, sebastianus . COMMENTS: Rosevear (1969) described the historical allocations of longicaudatus to Aethomys , Dasymys , Epimys , Mus , Rattus , and Stochomys . Morphometric analyses, which resulted in distinguishing two distinct subspecies, reported by Van der Straeten (1984) .
Sundamys muelleri (Jentink, 1879) . Notes Leyden Mus., 2:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Sumatra , Batang Singgalang, Padang Highlands . DISTRIBUTION: Sunda Shelf only: SW peninsular Burma , peninsular Thailand , Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Palawan, and many smaller islands on the Shelf; records from islands off of Sunda Shelf (Nicobars, for example) proved to represent other species (see maps in Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). SYNONYMS: balabagensis, balmasus , borneanus , campus, chombolis , crassus , credulus, culionensis , domitor , firmus , foederis, integer , otiosus, pinatus , pollens , potens , sebucus , terempa, valens , validus , victor , virtus , waringensis. COMMENTS: Morphological, chromosomal, and spermatozoal data suggested S. muelleri is a distant relative of Rattus but in the same monophyletic clade ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Populations from SW Burma , Peninsular Thailand , and the Malay Peninsula are significantly larger in body size than those from elsewhere on the Sunda Shelf and may be different species ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Sundamys maxi (Sody, 1932) . Natuurh. Maandbl. Maastricht., 21:157 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Java , Bandung, Cibuni . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from W Java between 900 and 1350 m . COMMENTS: A distinctive species and member of the suite of endemic Javanese murines (Musser, 1986). Still only represented by specimens collected between 1932 and 1935 by Max Bartels Jr. Phylogenetic relationship may be closer to S. muelleri than to S. infraluteus .

Formerly included in Rattus by Ellerman (1949a) , and in subgenus Bullimus of genus Rattus by Misonne (1969) , but considered a distinct genus by Musser (1984 , 1987) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) . Partially reviewed and contrasted with Sundaic Sundamys by Musser and Newcomb (1983) . Marked interspecific contrasts in spermatozoal morphology evident among species and reflected differences in cranial and dental traits ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ).

DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Florida Isl in the Solomon Arch. ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ). COMMENTS: Originally described as a Mus , the species was transferred to Uromys (Riimmler, 1938; Tate, 1951 ), but then correctly placed in Solomys by Troughton (1936) . Known by a few extant specimens. S. salamonis is also recorded from Nggela Island ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ), but Flannery (in litt.) claimed the species is known only from the skull of the holotype .

Solomys Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:261 . TYPE SPECIES: Uromys sapientis Thomas, 1902 . SYNONYMS: Unicomys . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea region Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Included in Melomys by Ellerman (1941:226) , then transferred to Uromys by Tate (1951:312) , but finally recognized again as a distinct genus ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ; Laurie and Hill, 1954:128 ). Presumably related to Uromys and Melomys , but no adequate diagnosis and definition of the genus and assessment of its phylogenetic relationships is yet available.
Rhynchomys Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:160 . TYPE SPECIES: Rhynchomys soricoides Thomas, 1895 . COMMENTS: Member of the Philippine Old Endemics, phylogenetic relationships with other genera of shrew rats are ambiguous ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ).
Solomys spriggsarum Flannery and Wickler, 1990 . Aust . Mamm., 13:133 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Buka Isl, Kilu rockshelter . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Buka Isl. COMMENTS: Known only by subfossil archaeological material ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ).
Solomys sapientis (Thomas, 1902) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:44 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Santa Ysabel Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Ysabel Isl ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ). COMMENTS: Represented by extant specimens.
Stenocephalemys albocaudata Frick, 1914 . Ann. Carnegie Mus., 9:8 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Ethiopia , Chilalo Mtns, Inyala Camp . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia ; endemic to the E plateau between 3000 and 4050 m . COMMENTS: Inhabits the Afro-alpine moorland where it occurs with Arvicanthis blicki , Lophuromys melanonyx , and Tachyoryctes macrocephalus , which are also moorland specialists ( Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden, 1988 ).
Spelaeomys florensis Hooijer, 1957 . Zool. Meded. Leiden, 35:306 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara , Palau Flores , Manggarai Prov., Liang Toge, a cave near Warukia, 1 km south of Lepa . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Flores Isl. COMMENTS: Represented only by subfossil fragments (3000-4000 years old), but may still live on Flores , and possibly other nearby islands.
Stenocephalemys griseicauda Petter, 1972 . Mammalia, 36:171 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Bale Mtns, Dinsho . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia ; S and N highlands, 2400-3900 m ( Demeter and Topal, 1982 ; Yalden, 1988 ). COMMENTS: Another Ethiopian mountain endemic that overlaps altitudinally with S. albocaudata but occupies bushy areas rather than moorland ( Yalden, 1988 ).
Srilankamys ohiensis (Phillips, 1929) . Ceylon J. Sci., Sec. B, 15:167 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sri Lanka ( Ceylon ), Ohiya, W Haputale, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Primary lowland evergreen tropical and montane rainforest formations on mountains in Uva and Central Provinces of Sri Lanka between 3000 and 7000 ft ( Phillips, 1980 ). COMMENTS: Musser (1981 b) described the history of past and incorrect allocations of ohiensis to groups that were eventually recognized as the genera Apomys , Lenothrix , Leopoldamys , Maxomys , Niviventer , and Rattus .
Spelaeomys Hooijer, 1957 . Zool. Meded. Leiden, 35:306 . TYPE SPECIES: Spelaeomys florensis Hooijer, 1957 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1981c) , who also recorded past opinions about phylogenetic affinities of Spelaeomys , noted that it is not closely related to Hooijeromys , Komodomys , Papagomys , or Paulamys — the other Nusa Tenggara endemics—and hypothesized that " Spelaeomys belongs with the old native genera of New Guinea , possibly Australia , and likely Timor." Additional data is required to test this notion.
Stenocephalemys Frick, 1914 . Ann. Carnegie Mus., 9:7 . TYPE SPECIES: Stenocephalemys albocaudata Frick, 1914 . COMMENTS: An Ethiopian endemic that is phylogenetically closely related to the Ethiopian endemics Myomys albipes and M. ruppi ( Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1983 ; see those accounts), and through them to the other species of Myomys .
Srilankamys Musser, 1981 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 168:268 . TYPE SPECIES: Rattus ohiensis Phillips, 1929 . COMMENTS: A montane insular relict with possible phylogenetic ties to Chiromyscus , Maxomys , and Niviventer , but not to Rattus ( Musser, 1981b ) .
Rattus turkestanicus (Satunin, 1903) . Ann. Mus. Zool. Acad. Imp. Sci. St. Petersbourg, 7:588 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kirghizia , Oshskaya Obi., Lenniskii p-h, Arslanbob (= "Assam-bob"; see Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Records are from Kirghizia , NE Iran , N and E Afghanistan , N Pakistan , N India (Kashmir, Sikkim ), Nepal , and S China ( Yunnan and Guangdong ) (see Musser and Newcomb, 1985:15 ). SYNONYMS: celsus, gilgitianus, khumbuensis, rattoides ( Hodgson, 1845 , not Pictet and Pictet, 1844), shigarus, vicerex (see Corbet, 1978c ; Musser and Newcomb, 1985 ). COMMENTS: Despite continued use of rattoides for this complex ( Caldarini et al., 1989 ; Corbet, 1978c ), it is a synonym of R. rattus (Schütter and Thonglongya, 1971) . Three distinctive morphological, chromosomal, and geographic forms are included under turkestanicus ( Caldarini et al., 1989 ; Niethammer and Martens, 1975 ) and were first recognized by Hinton (1922) who treated all three as species ( R. turkestanicus , R. vicerex , and R. rattoides ) but also suggested that each may instead be a welldifferentiated subspecies. Rattus turkestanicus and R. vicerex were reported to occur sympatrically in Kashmir ( Chakraborty, 1983 ), but those identifications have to be verified. A careful systematic treatment is needed to determine whether the three groups represent species or geographic variants. Oldest name for the complex is pyctoris ( Hodgson, 1845 ; incorrectly listed as a synonym of R. nitidus by Ellerman, 1961 ) and would either replace turkestanicus if all samples represent a single species, or would identify Nepal and Sikkim populations.
Rattus timorensis Kitchener, Aplin, and Boeadi, 1991 . Rec. West. Aust . Mus., 15:446 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara , Timor, Gunung Mutis, 1900 m, 7 km E Desa Nenas . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Represented only by the holotype . Some of the large series of subfossil fragments collected in E Timor by Glover (1986) may be this species. Phylogenetic affinities unknown, and possibly not even a member of Rattus ( Kitchener et al., 1991 b ) .
Rattus tawitawiensis Musser and Heaney, 1985 . Am. Mus. Novit., 2818:5 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Sulu Arch., Tawitawi Isl, Batu Batu . DISTRIBUTION: Tawitawi Island in southern part of Sulu Arch. COMMENTS: Known only by three specimens . Phylogenetic affinities unclear; in some traits resembles Sulawesian R. hoffmanni more closely than any other described species of Rattus from the Indo-Australian region (Musser and Heaney, 1985).
Rattus tiomanicus (Miller, 1900) . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:212 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Pahang , Tioman Isl, off the east coast Malay Peninsula . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to the Sunda Shelf and some offshore islands. Records on the Shelf are from peninsular Thailand south of Isthmus of Kra ( 10°30'N ), the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Bali, Borneo, Palawan, and many smaller islands. Off the Sunda Shelf, R. tiomanicus is documented from Enggano Isl, southwest of Sumatra, and Maratua Arch., east of Borneo (Musser and Calafia, 1982; Musser and Heaney, 1985). SYNONYMS: ambersoni, banguei, batin, blangorum , delirius, ducis, generatius, jalorensis , jarak , jemuris, julianus , kabanicus, kunduris, lamucotanus, lasurius, luxuriosus, maerens , mangalumis, mara , pauper, payanus, pemanggis, perhentianus, pharus, piperis, rhionis, roa , roquei, rumpia, sabae, sebasianus, siantanicus , sribuatensis, tambelanicus , tenggolensis, terutavensis, tingius , tua , vernalus, viclana. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser and Califia (1982) , who also summarized and provided references documenting the incorrect historical association of tiomanicus and the other synonyms listed here as subspecies of R. rattus . They also pointed out that a careful study of interisland variation among named forms of the R. tiomanicus complex is necessary before relationships among the insular populations can be discerned; more than one species, for example, may be represented in what is now viewed as R. tiomanicus . Rattus mindorensis from Mindoro Island in the Philippines , R. simalurensis from the islands of Babi, Lasia, Siumat, and Simalule, off the northwest coast of Sumatra; and R. burrus from some of the Nicobar islands are also morphologically very similar to the R. tiomanicus complex and should be considered part of it (Musser, 1986; Musser and Heaney, 1985). Whether they are species or island forms of R. tiomanicus has yet to be determined.
Rattus tunneyi (Thomas, 1904) . Novit. Zool., 11:223 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , Mary River . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; NE and SW Western Australia , Northern Territory , E Queensland , and NE New South Wales . Also recorded from offshore islands. Extant range vastly reduced from former distribution (see map in Taylor and Horner, 1973:89 , and discussion in Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). SYNONYMS: apex, austrinus , culmorum , dispar , melvilleus , vallesius, woodwardi . COMMENTS: This species hybridized in the laboratory with R. colletti ( Baverstock et al., 1983a , 1986).
Rhabdomys pumilio (Sparrman, 1784) . K. Svenska Vet.-Akad. Handl. Stockholm , p. 236 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Africa, S Cape Prov. , east of Knysna, Tsitsikamma Forest, Slangrivier . DISTRIBUTION: S and C Angola , Namibia , Botswana , South Africa , E Zimbabwe , WC Mozambique , Malawi (Nyika Plateau and Mulanje massif), NE Zambia (Nyika plateau), and highlands in Tanzania , Kenya , Uganda , and SE Zaire . SYNONYMS: angolae , bechuanae , bethuliensis, chakae, cinereus , cradockensis, deserti , dilectus , diminutus , donavani , fouriei, griquae, griquoides, intermedius , lineatus , pumilio var. major , meridionalis , moshesh, namaquensis , namibensis, nyasae , orangiae , prieskae, septemvittatus , typicus , vaalensis, vittatus . COMMENTS: When Wroughton (1905b) reviewed pumilio , he distinguished four groups, each with different forms, and although unsure about the taxonomic status to give the forms, thought each group represented a separate species. Distribution of character variation, however, forced him to conclude that (p. 630) " in view of the absolute identity of pattern, the variability of coloration, and the difficulty of deciding the inter-relationship of the different forms, the simpler and safer way is to call them all subspecies of the original species pumilio ." Wroughton's view prevails today. Checklists ( Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Ellerman et al., 1953), faunal studies (e.g., Ansell, 1978 ; Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ; Roberts, 1951 ; Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ; Smithers, 1971 ), a study of possible influences of climate on length of tail ( Coetzee, 1970 ), and preliminary studies on geographic variation (see Meester et al., 1986:275 ) have yet to critically analyze patterns of chromatic and morphological variation in context of assessing whether only one or several species exist. Hill and Carter (1941: 101) recognized two species in Angola ; R. pumilio from central and southern regions, and R. bechuanae form the arid southwestern portion north of Namibia . They noted the lack of intergradation between the two kinds and we have not found any evidence that such intergradation exists. The significance of this observation can only be assessed by careful sysematic review of Rhabdomys . Morphology of digestive system in relation to diet and evolution described by Perrin and Curtis (1980) .
Rattus villosissimus (Waite, 1898) . Proc. R. Soc. Victoria , 10:125 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , "from probably the vicinity of Goonhaghooheeny Billabong, Cooper Creek" (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; broad inland range from NW Western Australia through Northern Territory into most of Queensland and N South Australia and N New South Wales (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:245 ). SYNONYMS: longipilis (Gould, 1854, not Waterhouse, 1837), profusus. COMMENTS: Geographic range is allopatric to the coastal R. sordidus in Queensland and R. colletti in Northern Territory (see map in Taylor and Horner, 1973:72 ). The three species are closely related; villosissimus was treated as a subspecies of R. sordidus by Taylor and Horner (1973) , but is considered genically closer to colletti by Baverstock et al. (1983a , 1986 ). See accounts of sordidus and colletti . Analyses of electrophoretic data by Gemmeke and Niethammer (1984) indicated R. villosissimus to be greatly separated from R. argentiventer , R. exulans , R. norvegicus , and R. tiomanicus , and closer to species of Bandicota and Maxomys .
Rattus xanthurus (Gray, 1867) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1867:598 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , NE Sulawesi , Tondano, 3600 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; northern arm, central core, and SE peninsula. Absent from the SW peninsula where it is replaced by R. foramineus in coastal lowlands and R. bontanus on Gunung Lampobatang. Occurs sympatrically with R. marmosurus on the NE Peninsula. SYNONYMS: faberi , facetus , orientalis , paraxanthus , salocco (see Musser, 1971c-e, 1984). COMMENTS: Member of the group which includes R. bontanus , R. foramineus , R. marmosurus , and R. pelurus . Sody (1941) included xanthurus in Taeromys . Although the R. xanthurus group may eventually be removed from Rattus ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ) , it does not belong in Taeromys .
Rhabdomys Thomas, 1916 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 18:69 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus pumilio Sparrman, 1784 .
Zyzomys woodwardi (Thomas, 1909) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 3:373 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , E Kimberly, Parrys Creek, near Windham, 100 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; Kimberleys of Western Australia and Arnhem Land (western escarpments) of Northern Territory (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:141 ). COMMENTS: Restricted to rocky regions, especially boulders at the base of cliffs; limited in distribution but common at some localities ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ).
Myospalax aspalax (Pallas, 1776) . Reise Prov. Russ. Reichs., 3:692 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Transbaikalia, Dauuria ("Doldogo, on Onon River, below Atchinsk," Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:652 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Russia (Upper Amur basin) and China ( Nei Mongol ). SYNONYMS: armandii , dybowskii , talpinus , zokor . COMMENTS: Listed, with a question mark, as a subspecies of M. myospalax by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , and unequivically as M. m. aspalax by Corbet (1978c) , but separated on morphological grounds by Lawrence (1991) and others cited in her report. Closest phylogenetic relative is the Lower Pleistocene M. pseudarmandi , and both are in same monophyletic species-group containing the modern M. epsilanus , M. myospalax , and Pliocene M. youngi ( Lawrence, 1991 ) .
Myospalax fontanierii (Milne-Edwards, 1867) . Ann. Sci. Nat. (Paris), 7:376 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Kansu . DISTRIBUTION: Dry grasslands from Gansu , Ningxia ( Qin, 1991 ) through Hupeh and Anhui to Sichuan ( China ). SYNONYMS: baileyi , cansus , fontanus , kukunoriensis , rufescens , shenseius. COMMENTS: Phylogenetically in same monophyletic group as M. smithii and M. rothschildi , which is the most derived group within the subfamily ( Lawrence, 1991 ). Fan and Shi (1982) recognized cansus and baileyi as species, but Li and Chen (1989) argued for their recognition as subspecies of M. fontanierii .
Myospalax epsilanus Thomas, 1912 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 9:94 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Heilongjiang Prov. (Manchuria), Khingan Mtns, 3400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: NE China (valleys of Great Khiaghau in Kirin Province) and Russia (E Transbaikalia between Amur and S Ussuri Territory); limits unknown. COMMENTS: The most primitive member of the monophyletic myospalax species-group, which includes species represented by modern specimens as well as Pliocene and Pleistocene fossils ( Lawrence, 1991 ).

COMMENTS: Phylogenetic relationships reviewed by Lawrence (1991) , who provided references to systematic and genetic studies of living forms in the former USSR. Chinese taxa have been reviewed, with different results, by Fan and Shi (1982) and Li and Chen (1989) .
Subfamily Myospalacinae Lilljeborg, 1866 . Syst. öfversigt. Gnag. Däggdjuren, p. 25 . SYNONYMS: Myotalpinae, Siphneinae. COMMENTS: Diagnosis, morphological and chromosomal characteristics, and general remarks on habits, habitat, distribution, geologic range, fossil groups, and phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily and with other muroid groups were provided by Carleton and Musser (1984) . Results of phylogenetic analysis of living and some extinct species were reported by Lawrence (1991) .
Mystromys Wagner, 1841 . Gelehrte Anz. I. K. Bayer. Akad. Wiss., München, 12(54), col. 434 . TYPE SPECIES: Mystromys albipes Wagner, 1841 (= Otomys albicaudatus A. Smith, 1834 ). COMMENTS: Gross morphology of male accessory glands described by Voss and Linzey (1981) in context of survey assessing systematic implications of these structures among muroid rodents. Gross and histological stomach anatomy, as well as developmental and physiological aspects of gastric structure and processes, reported by Perrin and Curtis (1980) , Maddock and Perrin (1981 , 1983), and Perrin and Maddock (1983) , and presented in comparative context to discern evolutionary relationships among Southern African muroid rodents, and in context of function and diet.
Myospalax psilurus (Milne-Edwards, 1874) . Rech. Hist. Nat. Mammifères, p. 126 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Chihli, south of Peking . DISTRIBUTION: Transbaikalia and Ussuri region of Russia to E Mongolia , NE and C China ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: spilurus . COMMENTS: The sole member of the psilurus species-group, which is defined, except for rootless hypsodonty, by retention of the greatest number of primitive traits of any species in the genus ( Lawrence, 1991 ).
Myospalax myospalax (Laxmann, 1773) . Kongl. Svenska. Vet.-Akad. Handl. Stockholm , 34:134 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Altai Krai , 100 km SE of Barnaul, Sommaren, near Paniusheva on Alei River . DISTRIBUTION: Russia and Kazakhstan (entire N region of Cisaltai plain and foothills as well as the W and C Altai). SYNONYMS: incertus , komurai , laxmanni , tarbagataicus. COMMENTS: Member of monophyletic myospalax species-group, which includes living M. epsilanus , M. aspalax , and the Pliocene and Pleistocene M. youngi and M. pseudarmandi ( Lawrence, 1991 ) .
Myospalax smithii Thomas, 1911 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 8:720 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Gansu , 30 mi SE Tao-chou . DISTRIBUTION: China , Gansu and Ningxia ( Qin, 1991 ). COMMENTS: Phylogenetically closely allied to M. rothschildi , and in same monophyletic group with M. fontanierii , a cluster defined by a suite of highly derived morphological features ( Lawrence, 1991 ).
Myospalax rothschildi Thomas, 1911 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 8:722 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Gansu , 40 mi SE Tao-chou . DISTRIBUTION: China ; Kansu and Hubei . SYNONYMS: hubeinensis, minor . COMMENTS: The sister-species of M. smithii , and in same monophyletic cluster as M. fontainieri , as determined by cladistic analysis of external, cranial, and dental traits ( Lawrence, 1991 ). Recently, hubeinensis was described as subspecies of M. rothschildi by Li and Chen (1989) .
Subfamily Mystromyinae Vorontsov, 1966 . Zool. Zh., 45:437 . COMMENTS: Phylogenetic allocation of Mystromys so puzzled Ellerman (1941:445) that he wrote "I am entirely at a loss to suggest the relationships of this genus, which seems not only isolated from the Palaearctic and Neotropical genera, but to have no marked generic characters ... " Based on study of external, skeletal, dentition, gastrointestinal, genital and other anatomical characteristics of Mystromys albicaudatus, Vorontsov (1966) concluded the species was not closely related to Palaearctic hamsters and placed Mystromys in the monotypic tribe Mystromyini . Carleton and Musser (1984:313) remarked that Mystromys is possibly a survivor of an ancient phyletic line, pointing out that Lavocat (1973 , 1978 ) "raised such a novel possibility for Mystromys by noting its probable derivation from afrocricetodontine rodents and by recognizing the subfamily Mystromyinae in the Nesomyidae , a family composed of archaic African cricetids that he derived from the afrocricetodontines, the African counterpart to European and Asian cricetodontines." Pocock (1987) and Skinner and Smithers (1990) retained Mystromys in the Cricetinae of family Cricetidae .
Zelotomys Osgood, 1910 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:7 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus hildegardeae Thomas, 1902 . SYNONYMS: Ochromys . COMMENTS: Similar to Lophuromys in molar occlusal patterns ( Misonne, 1969 ) and other features, but strength of phylogenetic link to either that genus or other murines requires assessment by further study.
Xenuromys barbatus (Milne-Edwards, 1900) . Bull. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, 6:167 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , "British New Guinea ." DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Represented by only a few specimens collected along the Central Cordillera from Mt Dayman in E Papua New Guinea to the Idenberg River in Irian Jaya ( Flannery, 1990b ; Flannery et al., 1985 ). STATUS: IUCN - Rare. SYNONYMS: guba. COMMENTS: Closest phylogenetic relatives appear to be species of Uromys ( Tate, 1951 ) .
Xeromys myoides Thomas, 1889 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1889:248 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Mackay . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; C and S Queensland , North Stradbroke Island off the coast of SE Queensland ( Van Dyck et al., 1979 ), Northern Territory , and Melville Island off the coast of Northern Territory ; probably has a wider range ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). STATUS: CITES - Appendix I; U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Rare. COMMENTS: Closely associated with tidal mangrove swamps and still known only by small samples, most of which have been collected since 1970 ( Dwyer et al., 1979 ; Van Dyck et al., 1979 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). Morphology of sperm head structure and male reproductive tract studied by Breed (1984 , 1986) in context of comparative study among Australian murines. Chromosomal complement similar to that of Hydromys chrysogaster ( Baverstock et al., 1977c ) , as is primitive pattern of cephalic arterial configuration. Mahoney and Richardson (1988: 190) cataloged references to taxonomy and natural history.
Vernaya fulva (G. M. Allen, 1927) . Am. Mus. Novit., 270 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Yunnan , Yinpankai, Mekong River . DISTRIBUTION: S China ( Sichuan and Yunnan ) and N Burma ; known only from above 7000 ft. SYNONYMS: foramena. COMMENTS: Originally described by Allen as a species of Chiropodomys , but later reidentified by him as the only example of Vandeleuria dumeticola known from Yunnan (Allen, 1940). Anthony (1941) correctly pointed out the morphological uniqueness of fulva by erecting a new genus to contain it. Still known only by very few specimens. Wang et al. (1980) described foramena as a species of Vernaya , but diagnostic traits simply represent individual variation found in V. fulva .
Xenuromys Tate and Archbold, 1941 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1101:3 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus barbatus Milne-Edwards, 1900 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ).
Xeromys Thomas, 1889 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1889:248 . TYPE SPECIES: Xeromys myoides Thomas, 1889 . COMMENTS: Member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c: 166 ) or Hydromyini of Baverstock (1984) , and Lee et al. (1981) . Xeromys is phylogenetically distantly related to Hydromys , although the two are still sister genera ( Watts et al., 1992 ).
Vernaya Anthony, 1941 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi. Zool. Ser., 27: 110 . TYPE SPECIES: Chiropodomys fulvus G. M. Allen, 1927 . SYNONYMS: Octopodomys . COMMENTS: Dental morphology interpreted by Misonne (1969) to indicate close relationship with Chiropodomys ; hypothesis requires testing with other characters. About the same time Anthony proposed Vernaya, Sody (1941) proposed Octopodomys .
Zyzomys pedunculatus (Waite, 1896) . Rept. Horn Sci. Exped. Cent . Aust ., Zool., 2:395 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , Alice Springs, but this locality is suspect ( Kitchener, 1989 ) . DISTRIBUTION: C Australia ; Northern Territory (see map and discussion in Watts and Aslin, 1981:143 ). STATUS: CITES - Appendix I; U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered. SYNONYMS: brachyotis. COMMENTS: Rare (now even believed extinct, Flannery, in litt.) and restricted to rocks. Distribution of fossils indicated species "may once have extended across the rocky ranges of central Western Australia , through the Hamersleys to the coast" ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:143 ).

DISTRIBUTION: S Africa (N Cape Province), SW and N Botswana , and Namibia (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). COMMENTS: Past allocations have been with Aethomys , Rattus , and Thallomys ; see D. H. S. Davis (1965) and references in Meester et al. (1986) .
Zyzomys argurus (Thomas, 1889) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 3:433 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , probably Northern Territory (see Mahoney and Richardson (1988:191) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; always in rocky outcrops in Pilbara region of Western Australia through Kimberleys to N coastal Queensland between Cooktown and Townsville; also on offshore islands (see Watts and Aslin, 1981:138 ). SYNONYMS: indutus . COMMENTS: Electrophoretic comparisons between populations discordant with chromosomal differences ( Baverstock et al., 1977d ).

Zyzomys Thomas, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 3:372 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus argurus Thomas, 1889 . SYNONYMS: Laomys . COMMENTS: Member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c:167 ) or Conilurini of Baverstock (1984) and Lee et al. (1981) . Taxonomy of species appraised by Kitchener (1989) . Chromosomal morphology distinct from other Australian murines ( Baverstock et al., 1977c ), but this result was not supported by electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ), and G-banding homologies suggested karyotype of Zyzomys "to be derived from the ancestral karyotype characterizing Conilurus , Mesembriomys , and Leggadina ” ( Baverstock et al., 1983b ). Molar traits resembled those characterizing Conilurus ( Misonne, 1969 ) , but phallic characters linked Zyzomys to Pseudomys and its close relatives ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ). Data from microcomplement fixation of albumin indicated Zyzomys belongs in a clade with Mesembriomys , Conilurus , Leporillus , and Melomys ( Watts et al., 1992 ). External morphology of glans penis and spermatozoal structure reported by Breed, 1984 ), Breed and Sarafis, 1978 ; and Morrissey and Breed (1982) . Mahoney and Richardson (1988) cataloged taxonomic, distributional, and biological references to some of the species.
Uromys hadrourus (Winter, 1983) . In The Australian Museum Complete Book of Australian Mammals (R. Strahan, ed.), p. 379 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , NE Queensland , Thornton Peak summit area, 1200 m (see Winter, 1984 , for additional data) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only by five specimens (Groves and Flannery, in litt.) from rainforest on Mareeba Franite of the Thornton Peak massif ( Winter, 1983 , 1984 ). COMMENTS: Subgenus Uromys . Originally described as a species of Melomys, Groves and Flannery (in litt.) have shown that hadrourus belongs in Uromys and is closely related to U. caudimaculatus . U. hadrourus is a member of a group of species that are endemic to "the Townsville to Cooktown region, and considered to be relicts of a wet- and cool-adapted fauna which may have orinigated in Australia from a common pre-Pleisocene stock of Australia and New Guinea " ( Winter, 1984:525 ). Chromosomal morphology reported by Baverstock et al. (1977c) . McAllan and Bruce (1989) explained why 1983 is the publication date for hadrourus instead of 1984 as is usually accepted, and pointed out that the species was first given the name Melanomys hadrourus . That generic name is preoccupied by Melanomys Thomas, 1902 .
Uranomys ruddi Dollman, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:552 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Mt Elgon, Kirui, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Senegal , Guinea , Ivory Coast , Togo , N Nigeria , N Camaroon, NE Zaire , Uganda , Kenya , C Mozambique , Malawi , and SE Zimbabwe ; limits unknown; a savanna species. SYNONYMS: acomyoides , foxi , oweni , shortridgei , tenebrosus, ugandae , woodi. COMMENTS: Chromosomal data was presented by Viegas-Pequignot et al. (1983) in context of chromosomal phylogeny of selected murines; protein electrophoretic data analysed by Iskandar and Bonhomme (1984) . More than one species may be represented among samples. Specimens of shortridgei , for example, are darker than the others and have much larger molars. The significance of geographic variation in fur color and craniodental traits has to be assessed in a systematic revision of the genus.
Uromys caudimaculatus (Krefft, 1867) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1867:316 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Cape York . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; NE coastal Queensland in tropical forests from Townsville area north to tip of Cape York, and a few islands off the coast of N Queensland ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:91 ). New Guinea ; widespread throughout lowland and midmontane regions on the mainland, also on Aru Isis, Kei Isis, Waigeo Isl, and Normanby and Fergusson in the d'Entrecasteaux Arch. SYNONYMS: aruensis , ductor , exilis , lamington , macropus , multiplicatus, nero , papuanus , prolixus , scaphax , sherrini , siebersi , validus , waigeuensis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Uromys . The Australian population has been studied from viewpoints of chromosomal morphology ( Baverstock et al., 1977c ), heterochromatin variation (Baverstock et al., 19766, 1982), electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ), Gbanding homologies (Baverstock et al., 19836), morphology of male reproductive tract (Breed, 1986), and spermatozoa! morphology ( Breed, 1984 ; Breed and Sarafis, 1978 ). Donnellan (1987) provided chromosomal data for samples from New Guinea . Mahoney and Richardson (1988: 189) cataloged taxonomic, distributional, and biological references covering Australian populations. Two different chromosomal forms of Australian U. caudimaculatus exist, one extending from Mcllwraith Ranges northward, the other from Cooktown southward; each is separated by a 200 km break in rainforest (Baverstock et al., 19766, 1977c). Phallic morphology of New Guinea samples reported by Lidicker (1968). Significance of the morphological variation among samples from New Guinea and adjacent islands needs to be assessed in context of systematic revision to determine how many species actually exist, a study that has now been completed (Groves and Flannery, in litt.).
Uromys anak Thomas, 1907 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 20:72 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., Brown River, Efogi, "not less than" 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; throughout the Central Cordillera from Weyland Range in the west to Mt Dayman in the east as well as the Huon Peninsula (see map in Flannery, 19906:219). SYNONYMS: rothschildi . COMMENTS: Subgenus Uromys . Closely related to U. neobritanicus .
Uromys Peters, 1867 . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , p. 343 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus macropus Gray, 1866 (= Hapalotis caudimaculatus Krefft, 1867 ). SYNONYMS: Cyromys , Gymnomys, Melanomys ( Winter, 1983 , not Thomas, 1902). COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea and Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). The genus has been revised by Groves and Flannery (in litt.), who arrange the species in two subgenera, Uromys and Cyromys ).
Uromys imperator (Thomas, 1888) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 1:157 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Guadalcanal Isl, Aola . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Guadalcanal Isl. COMMENTS: Subgenus Cyromys . Historically, this species has been assigned to either Uromys or Cyromys , but is now regarded as a member of the former ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ; Groves and Flannery, in litt.). Known only by a few specimens (Flannery, 1991).
Uromys neobritanicus Tate and Archbold, 1935 . Am. Mus. Novit., 803:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Bismarck Arch., New Britain Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to New Britain Isl. COMMENTS: Subgenus Uromys . Included in U. anak by Ziegler (1982b:882) without explanation, but neobritanicus is diagnosed by distinctive external and cranial traits that are outside the range of morphological variation characteristic of U. anak (Groves and Flannery, in litt.). Chromosomal data reported by Donnellan (1987) .
Uromys rex (Thomas, 1888) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 1:157 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Guadalcanal Isl, Aola . DISTRIBUTION: Found only on Guadalcanal Isl. COMMENTS: Subgenus Cyromys . Another Guadalcanal species that has historically been placed in either Uromys or Cyromys , but is currently allocated to the former ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ; Groves and Flannery, in litt.). Still represented by less than a dozen specimens (Flannery, 1991).
Uromys porculus Thomas, 1904 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 14:400 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Guadalcanal Isl, Aola . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Guadalcanal Isl. COMMENTS: Subgenus Cyromys . Although originally described as a species of Uromys , it was transferred to Melomys ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Rümmler, 1938 ), placed back in Uromys ( Tate, 1951 ) , again put in Melomys ( Laurie and Hill, 1954 ) , and has currently been returned to Uromys ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ; Groves and Flannery, in litt.).
Vandeleuria nolthenii Phillips, 1929 . Ceylon J. Sci., Sec. B, 15: 165 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sri Lanka , Uva , Ohiya, West Haputale, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Highlands (above 3800 ft ) of Central and Uva provinces of Sri Lanka . COMMENTS: Usually considered a subspecies of V. oleracea ( Agrawal and Chakraborty, 1980 ; Ellerman, 1961 ), nolthenii is distinct in its montane distribution, pelage coloration, and external and cranial traits from V. oleracea occuring at lower elevations, and should be treated as a separate species (Musser, 1979).
Vandeleuria Gray, 1842 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 10:265 TYPE SPECIES: Mus oleraceus Bennett, 1832 . COMMENTS: Allied to Chiropodomys and Micromys , a hypothesis based on dental morphology ( Misonne, 1969 ) and one that requires testing with other character sets.
Vandeleuria oleracea (Bennett, 1832) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1832:121 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Madras, Deccan region . DISTRIBUTION: Peninsular India , Sri Lanka (lowlands), Nepal to Burma , S China ( Yunnan ), Thailand (except peninsula south of Isthmus of Kra, 10°30'N ), and Vietnam ; probably occurs throughout Indochina. SYNONYMS: badius , domecolus, dumeticola , marica , modesta , nilagirica , povensis , rubida, Sibylla , spadicea , wroughtoni . COMMENTS: Chromosomal features vary geographically (see Winking et al, 1979 , and references therein), as do chromatic and cranial traits; oleracea is possibly a composite of species, and despite Agrawal and Chakraborty's (1980) review of geographic variation, needs careful systematic revision.
Thamnomys kempi Dollman, 1911 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 8:658 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Zaire , Buhamba, near Lake Kivu, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: E Zaire , W Uganda , and NW Burundi ; a montane Western Rift Valley endemic. SYNONYMS: major . COMMENTS: A distinctive species as listed by Allen (1939) and Ellerman (1941) , not a subspecies of T. venustus . Both species are sympatric at Kibati in E Zaire (documented by specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard).
Thallomys paedulcus (Sundevall, 1846) . Ofv. K. Svenska Vet.-Akad. Forhandl. Stockholm , 3:120 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , "In Caffraria interiore, prope tropicum," according to Ellerman et al. (1953). D. H. S. Davis (1965: 127) reported that "type locality was in the Magaliesberg area and has been provisionally fixed as Crocodile Drift, Brits, Transvaal." DISTRIBUTION: From S Africa (N Natal, Transvaal, Zululand), Swaziland , and S Botswana north through Zimbabwe , S Zambia , Mozambique , Malawi , Tanzania , Kenya to S Ethiopia and S Somalia ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: acaciae, lebomboensis, moggi , rhodesiae, ruddi , scotti , somaliensis, stevensoni , zambeziana. COMMENTS: In body size, the smallest of all the species. Identification of paedulcus as a separate species compared with the larger T. damarensis , and association of scotti with it, was correctly perceived and documented by Petter (1973a) . Thomas and Wroughton's (1908) ruddi , which was described as a species of Thamnomys , is a Thallomys ( Lawrence and Loveridge, 1953 ) and another example of T. paedulcus. Identification of the holotype of paedulcus, along with critical measurements, was recorded by Ellerman et al. (1953), and verified by Petter (1973a) . The names acaciae, lebomboensis, and stevensoni were listed by Roberts (1951) as subspecies of T. moggi; rhodesiae was described by Osgood (1910) as a subspecies of Mus damarensis (which is here synonymized in T. nigricauda); and zambeziana was proposed by Lundholm (1955b) as a subspecies of T. nigricauda. Roche (1964) described somaliensis as a subspecies of T. paedulcus.
Thallomys shortridgei Thomas and Hinton, 1923 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1923:492 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Africa, NW Cape Prov. , Louisvale, S bank of Orange River . DISTRIBUTION: South Africa ; known only from south bank of Orange River from about Upington west to Goodhouse, Little Namaqualand, in NW Cape Prov. ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Thomas and Hinton's (1923) acute description pointed to a distinctive species distinguished by a diagnostic combination of chromatic and cranial (especially the small bullae) traits. Ellerman (1941) treated shortridgei as a species, its distinction has been recognized by others ( Roberts, 1951 ; Van Rooyen in De Graff, 1978), and despite recent checklists where it is listed as a subspecies of either T. paedulcus ( Meester et al., 1986 ) or T. nigricauda ( Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ) , the name identifies a valid species.
Thamnomys Thomas, 1907 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7,19: 121 . TYPE SPECIES: Thamnomys venustus Thomas, 1907 . COMMENTS: Despite assertions that species of Thamnomys and Grammomys are in the same monophyletic group but separable at the subgeneric level ( Allen, 1939 ; Hatt, 1940a ; Hollister, 1919 ; Misonne, 1974 ; Petter and Tranier, 1975 ; and others—see references in Meester et al., 1986 ), Thamnomys is a distinct genus, as explained by Ellerman (1941) , Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) , Misonne (1969) , Rosevear (1969) , and other workers (see references in Meester et al., 1986 ). Those systematists, however, also included rutilans in Thamnomys , but we place it in Grammomys pending systematic revision of rutilons . Oenomys is the closest phylogenetic relative, a view presented more than fifty years ago by Hatt (1940a:522) : "Oenomys and Thamnomys bear much resemblance to each other, and I am inclined to believe that they represent respectively semiarboreal and arboreal descendants of a common stock."
Thamnomys venustus Thomas, 1907 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 19:122 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Ruwenzori East, 7000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: E Zaire , Uganda , and Rwanda : a montane Western Rift Valley endemic. SYNONYMS: kivuensis , schoutedeni. COMMENTS: Allen and Loveridge (1942) described kivuensis as a subspecies of T. venustus .
Tryphomys adustus Miller, 1910 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 38:399 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Luzon Isl, Benguet , Haights-in-the-Oaks . DISTRIBUTION: Luzon; known only from very few localities in highlands and lowlands ( Barbehenn et al., 1972 -1973; Sanborn, 1952a ).
Tokudaia osimensis (Abe, 1934) . J. Sci. Hiroshima Univ., ser. B, div. 1, 3:107 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan , Ryukyu Isls, Amami-oshima Isl, village of Sumiyo . DISTRIBUTION: Known only by modern samples from Amami-oshima Isl. COMMENTS: Impressive chromosomal distinctions between osimensis , muenninki , and a third unnamed species from Tokun-oshima Isl reported by Tsuchiya (1981) , and Tsuchiya et al. (1989) .
Tokudaia muenninki Johnson, 1946 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 59:170 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan , Ryukyu Isls, N Okinawa Isl, Hentona (western coast) . DISTRIBUTION: Known by modern specimens from Okinawa , and Late Pleistocene and Holocene samples from Okinawa and adjacent island of Le-jima ( Kawamura, 1989 ). STATUS: IUCN - Endangered. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of T. osimensis (Johnson, 1946) , chromosomal evidence, as well as external and cranial morphology, clearly distinguished muenninki as a separate species ( Tsuchiya, 1981 ).
Uranomys Dollman, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:551 . TYPE SPECIES: Uranomys ruddi Dollman, 1909 . COMMENTS: Allen (1939) listed seven species of Uranomys but noted that six of them would probably prove to be subspecies of U. ruddi , which is how the genus is currently treated ( Verheyen, 1964b ). In external, cranial, and dental traits, Uranomys is closely related to Acomys ( Hinton, 1921 ; Misonne, 1969 ), a phylogenetic alliance also supported by DNA (LINE) sequence analyses ( Pascale et al., 1990 ), and Lophuromys (our studies; Watts, in litt.; Denys and Michaux, 1992).
Tokudaia Kuroda, 1943 . Biogeographica, 139:61 . TYPE SPECIES: Rattus jerdoni osimensis Abe, 1934 . SYNONYMS: Acanthomys ( Tokuda, 1941 , not Lesson, 1842), Tokudamys . COMMENTS: In addition to two species listed below, a third, yet to be named and described, occurs on Tokun-oshima Isl in the Ryukyu group ( Tsuchiya, 1981 ; Tsuchiya et al., 1989 ). Best estimate of phylogenetic relationships, based on dental morphology, placed Tokudaia in a group containing Apodemus , Pliocene Rhagapodemus , and Quaternary Rhagamys ; and suggested that Tokudaia evolved from Miocene Parapodemus-Apodemus ancestral stock; its evolutionary link to primitive species of Apodemus may be found in Miocene or Pliocene sediments of China (see Kawamura, 1989 ).
Tryphomys Miller, 1910 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 38:399 . TYPE SPECIES: Tryphomys adustus Miller, 1910 . COMMENTS: Musser and Newcomb (1983) and Musser and Heaney (1992) revised the genus and documented the history of incorrect association of Tryphomys with Rattus . Treated as a Philippine New Endemic by Musser and Heaney (1992) . Tryphomys and Abditomys , another Luzon endemic, form a monophyletic cluster; the nature of their phylogenetic alliances to other genera of Philippine New Endemics, or to genera native to other regions in the Indo-Australian region, remains unresolved.
Rattus everetti (Günther, 1879) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1879:75 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , N Mindanao Isl ( Heaney and Rabor, 1982 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Islands of Luzon, Catanduanes , Mindoro, Sibuyan, Ticao, Camiguin , Samar , Calicoan, Leyte , Dinagat , Siargao, Mindanao, Basilan , Bohol , Biliran , and Maripipi; probably occurs on other islands in the Philippine archipelago ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). SYNONYMS: albigularis , gala , tagulayensis , tyrannus . COMMENTS: May be more than one species represented in insular samples ( tyrannus , for example), and the everetti complex needs critical systematic revision. Similar to the core group of Rattus in cranial, dental, and spermatozoal characters ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Musser and Heaney, 1992 ), but not closely related to other species of Rattus endemic to the Philipines. Member of the Philippine New Endemics, but distantly related to other genera in that group ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ).
Rattus burrus (Miller, 1902) . Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 24:768 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Nicobar Isis, Trinkat Island . DISTRIBUTION: Islands of Trinkat, Little Nicobar, and Great Nicobar in the Nicobar Archipelago. SYNONYMS: burrescens . COMMENTS: Except for larger body size, morphology closely resembles that of most samples of R. tiomanicus from the Sunda Shelf. Whether burrus is an endemic of the Nicobars or whether samples from the three islands are insular variants of R. tiomanicus needs to be tested by a systematic revision of the R. tiomanicus complex (Musser, 1986; Musser and Califia, 1982 ; Musser and Heaney, 1985).
Rattus bontanus Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 7:246 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , SW Sulawesi , Mt Bonthain (Gunung Lampobatang), 2000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from 600-2500 m on the slopes of Gunung Lampobatang, SW Sulawesi. COMMENTS: Sody (1941) questionably included this species in Taeromys, Laurie and Hill (1954) , and Musser (1984) treated it as a subspecies of R. xanthurus , but Musser and Holden (1991) contended that it is a distinct species most closely related to R. foramineus , which occurs in coastal lowlands of the southern end of the SW peninsula of Sulawesi .
Rattus enganus (Miller, 1906) . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 30:821 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Pulau Enggano (west of Sumatra and off the continental margin) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Enggano Isl. COMMENTS: Represented only by the holotype . Some cranial, dental, and external features resemble those in R. macleari from Christmas Island and R. xanthurus from Sulawesi, but the holotype of R. enganus is morphologically distinctive; determining its phylogenetic affinities within Rattus will require more specimens from Enggano Isl and revisionary study of the genus ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Rattus elaphinus Sody, 1941 . Treubia, 18:307 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Kepulauan Sula, Pulau Taliabu (east of Pulau Peleng and Sulawesi ) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Palau (Isl) Taliabu, Indonesia ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ) and adjacent Pulau Manggole (Flannery, in litt.). COMMENTS: A morphologically distinctive species that is most closely related to native Rattus on the Moluccas and New Guinea . Amplified description and comparisons with Sulawesian R. hoffmanni and R. koopmani from Peleng Isl provided by Musser and Holden (1991) .
Rattus colletti (Thomas, 1904) . Novit. Zool., 11:599 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , South Alligator River . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; known only from the coastal floodplains of the Northern Territory , the most restricted range of all the native Australian Rattus . (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). COMMENTS: Arranged as a subspecies of R. sordidus by Taylor and Horner (1973) , but subsequently treated as a separate species ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). Although diploid counts are very different, Rattus colletti (2N=42) is genically close to R. villosissimus (2N=50); the two hybridize in the laboratory, but the offspring exhibit severely reduced fertility ( Baverstock et al., 1983a , 1986). Fertile hybrids have been obtained between laboratory crosses of R. colletti and R. tunneyi , but the two are sympatric in the wild where no hybrids have been found ( Baverstock et al., 1983a ).
Rattus fuscipes (Waterhouse, 1839) . Zool. Voy. H.M.S. "Beagle," Mammalia, p. 66 . TYPE LOCALITY: Neotype from Australia , Western Australia , Albany, "Little Grove" on Princess Royal Harbor, 4 mi S Mt Melville; holotype was lost ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; Taylor and Horner, 1973 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Coastal, subcoastal, and offshore islands of SW Western Australia ; S coast from Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to W Victoria ; coastal and subcoastal Victoria from Otway Peninsula north to near Rockhampton in Queensland ; coastal Queensland from Townsville to Cooktown (see map in Taylor and Horner, 1973:15 ). SYNONYMS: assintilis, brazenori, coracius, glauerti , greyii , manicatus , mondraineus, murrayi , peccatus, pelori, ravus . COMMENTS: Taylor and Horner (1973) suggested, on morphological grounds, that the Queensland population of R. fuscipes (coracius) has a common ancestry with Queensland R. leucopus , a hypothesis reasserted by Taylor et al. (1982 , 1983 ). This relationship, however, is not supported by either chromosomal ( Dennis and Menzies, 1978 ) or biochemical data ( Baverstock et al., 1983a , 1986). See Taylor and Calaby (1988a , Mammalian Species, 298).
Rattus exulans (Peale, 1848) . Mammalia in Repts. U.S. Expl. Surv., 8:47 . TYPE LOCALITY: Society Isis, Tahiti Isl (France) . DISTRIBUTION: E Bangladesh , Burma , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia , Vietnam , Sundaic region (incl. Mentawai isls, and islands of Enggano, Nias, and Simeulule), Christmas Isl, Sulawesi, Philippines , Moluccas , Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Isis), New Guinea Region, two islands off the coast of N and NE Australia (not on mainland), Micronesia , New Zealand , and Polynesia, including Hawaii and Easter Isl. Not recorded from Andaman or Nicobar isls, despite assertion of Wodzicki and Taylor (1984) . SYNONYMS: aentuli, aitape, apicus, basilanus , bocourti , buruensis , calcis , clabatus , concolor , browni echimyoides, ephippiutn, equile, eurous, gawae, hawaiiensis , huegeli, jessook, lassacquerei, leucophaetus , luteiventris , malengiensis, manoquarius, maorium, mayonicus , Togomys melanoderma , meringgit, micronesiensis, negrinus, obscurus, ornatulus, otteni, pantarensis, praecelsus, pullus, querceti, raveni, rennelli, schuitemakeri, solatus, stragulum, suffectus, surdus, tibicen, todayensis, vigoratus, vitiensis, vulcani, wichmanni (see Dieterlen, in Ansell, 1989a ; Ellerman, 1961 ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Musser, 1970e , 1977a; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ; and Taylor et al., 1982 ). COMMENTS: Inadvertant human introduction responsible for most of the Pacific insular occurrences (see Roberts, 1991 ), and possibly for distribution outside of mainland SE Asia where species may have originated ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Rattus exulans has traditionally been included within subgenus Rattus along with R. argentiventer, R. nitidus, R. norvegicus, R. rattus, and others which have, in the past, formed the core of that group (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ; Misonne, 1969 ). Some electrophoretic and chromosomal data supported this allocation ( Raman and Sharma, 1977 ; Chan, 1977 ; Chan et al., 1979 ), but morphological and other biochemical data suggested the species is distant from R. rattus and its close relatives ( Gemmeke and Niethammer, 1984 ; Medway and Yong, 1976 ; Pasteur et al., 1982 ).
Rattus foramineus Sody, 1941 . Treubia, 18:308 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , SW Sulawesi , Bulukumba . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from a few localities on coastal lowlands near the end of the SW peninsula of Sulawesi . COMMENTS: Sody described pelurus from Pulau Peleng as a subspecies of R. foramineus , but the Peleng Isl rat is a distinct species ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). Rattus foramineus is represented only by four modern specimens ( Sody, 1941 ) and subfossil fragments ( Musser, 1984 ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ). Laurie and Hill (1954) listed R. foramineus as incertae sedis, but Musser (1984) treated it as a subspecies of R. xanthurus , and Musser and Holden (1991) considered it to be a species most closely related to R. bontanus , which replaces it on slopes of Gunung Lampobatang, Sulawesi.
Rattus feliceus Thomas, 1920 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 6:423 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Kepulauan Maluku , Pulau Seram, Gunung Manusela, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Seram Isl. COMMENTS: An amplified description and comparison with R. koopmani from Peleng Isl were provided by Musser and Holden (1991) , who also discussed past, and incorrect, subspecific allocations of feliceus to other species of Rattus . Phylogenetic affinities of R. feliceus are with species of Rattus endemic to New Guinea region ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ).
Rattus Fischer, 1803 . Natl. Mus. Nat. Paris, 2:128 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus decumanus Pallas, 1778 (see Hollister, 1916b ; = Mus norvégiens Berkenhout, 1769). SYNONYMS: Acanthomys (Gray, 1867, not Lesson, 1842, or Tokuda, 1941 ), Christomys, Cironomys , Epimys , Geromys , Mollicomys ; Octomys ( Sody, 1941 , not Thomas, 1922), Pullomys , Togomys . COMMENTS: Rattus Frisch, 1775 , is unavailable. Sody (1941) proposed the genera Christomys , Cironomys , Geromys , Mollicomys , Octomys , and Pullomys for various species we list in Rattus ; all are nomina nuda. Togomys is based on R. exulans (Dieterlen, in Ansell, 1989a ). Taxonomic changes altering the definition of Rattus as understood by Tate (1936), Ellerman (1941 , 1949«, 1961), and Simpson (1945) , were described and summarized by Misonne (1969) , Musser (1981b) , Musser and Newcomb (1983) , Musser and Holden (1991) , and Musser and Heaney (1992) . Species we list here can be sorted into the following groups. 1. The norvegicus group. Rattus norvegicus, the type species of the genus, is divergent from Rattus rattus in morphology as well as electrophoretic and immunological traits ( Chan, 1977 ; Chan et al., 1979 ; Baverstock et al., 1983«, c, 1986; Watts, in litt.) 2. The rattus group (adustus, argentiventer, baluensis, burrus, everetti, hoffmanni, koopmani, losea, lugens, mindorensis, mollicomulus, nitidus, osgoodi, palmarum, rattus, tanezumi, sikkimensis, simalurensis, tawitawiensis, tiomanicus, and turkestanicus). Morphology of these species generally reflects the conception of what is usually called subgenus Rattus ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). Whether or not this cluster, along with the norvegicus group, will eventually form the only contents of Rattus is a speculation that has to be assessed by systematic revision of the genus (Musser and Heaney, 1985, 1992; Musser and Holden, 1991 ). Comparative chromosomal data for many of these species were summarized by Musser and Holden (1991) . Schwarz and Schwarz (1967) offered a most peculiar and idiosyncratic revision of the group. 3. Native Australian species (colletti, fuscipes, lutreolus, sordidus, tunneyi, and villosissimus), which were revised by Taylor and Horner (1973) and are reviewed by Watts and Aslin (1981) ; one {sordidus) also occurs in New Guinea . Results from biochemical and chromosomal studies indicated the species form a monophyletic cluster to the exclusion of either R. rattus or R. norvegicus (Baverstock et al., 19774, 1983«, 1986). Baverstock et al. (1983«) proposed a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships based on cladistic analyses of electrophoretic, immunologic, and chromosomal data, and another proposed set of relationships assessed by isozyme elecrophoresis ( Baverstock et al., 1986 ). Mahoney and Richardson (1988) cataloged taxonomic, distributional, and biological references. This group may also include the endemics from Timor {timorensis) and Flores (hainaldi). Furthermore, such endemic Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Isis) genera as Komodomys are morphologically similar to some members of the Australian Rattus. 4. Native New Guinea species {jobiensis, leucopus, mordax, novaeguineae, praetor, sanila, steini, and probably giluwensis), which are indigenous to New Guinea and adjacent archipelagos; one (leucopus) also occurs in NE Australia . All have been the subject of a systematic revision by Taylor et al. (1982 , 1983 ). Known endemics of the Moluccas (elaphinus, feliceus, and probably morotaiensis) are also related to this group. Nature of the relationship among this group and members of Stenomys, members of the Australian cluster, and those genera of New Endemics native to the Philippine Isis ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) remains to be resolved. 5. The xanthurus group (bontanus, foramineus, marmosurus, pelurus, and xanthurus), which occurs on Sulawesi and adjacent Peleng Isl, and may eventually be removed from Rattus ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). Phylogenetic affinities of the remaining species listed below (annandalei, enganus, exulans, hoogerwerfi, macleari, montanus, nativitatis, ranjiniae, stoicus, and korinchi) are unresolved; some may eventually be excluded from the genus.
Pseudomys shortridgei (Thomas, 1907) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1906:765 [1907]. TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , SW Western Australia , neighborhood of Woyerling Reserve, 973 ft (additional information in Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:180 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; SW Western Australia and SW Victoria (Grampian Mtns and Portland areas); see map in Watts and Aslin (1981:185) . STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Vulnerable. COMMENTS: Thought to be extinct in Western Australia ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ), but recently rediscovered there ( Baynes et al., 1987 ). Electrophoretic data suggested P. shortridgei is phylogenetically isolated from all other species of Pseudomys ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) ; spermatozoal morphology unlike most other Pseudomys but similar to that of P. delicatulus , P. novaehollandiae , and P. pilligaensis (Breed, 1983) ; phallic anatomy linked P. shortridgei to P. albocinereus and P. fumeus , a group that could be generically recognized by calling it Gyomys ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987:635 ) .
Rattus adustus Sody, 1940 . Treubia, 17:397 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Pulau Enggano, off the coast of W Sumatra (and off the continental shelf), Kiojoh, sea level . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Enggano Isl. COMMENTS: Known only by the holotype . Although Sody (1940) described adustus as a species of Rattus , he later listed it as a subspecies of R. rattus in a section also containing lugens and mentaivai, populations endemic to the Mentawai islands ( Sody, 1941 ). The Enggano rat is distinctive; in morphology and geographic proximity it is related to R. lugens (Musser and Heaney, 1985) .
Rattus argentiventer (Robinson and Kloss, 1916) . J. Strs. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc., 73:274 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , west coast of Sumatra , Pasir Ganting . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Thailand , Koh Samui off the east coast of peninsular Thailand , Cambodia , and S Vietnam in Indochina; the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra , Java , Borneo, Kangean Isl, and Bali on the Sunda Shelf; islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Rintja, Flores , Sumba, and Timor in Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Isis); Mindoro and Mindanao Isis in the Philippines ; Sulawesi; and one place and date of collection in New Guinea . SYNONYMS: bali, brevicaudatus , chaseni, hoxaensis , pesticulus , saturnus, umbriventer . COMMENTS: The incorrect historical association of argentiventer as a subspecies of Rattus rattus was summarized by Musser (1973b) . Judged by its close morphological alliance with species Ellerman (1941) placed in subgenus Rattus , which are mostly mainland Asian in origins, and its peculiar geographic distribution that is discordant with ranges of endemic species, R. argentiventer seems clearly an element that is native to Indochina and was inadvertently introduced into the endemic and highly distinctive murine faunas of the Sunda Shelf, Philippines , Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and New Guinea ( Musser, 1973b ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ; Taylor et al., 1982 ), possibly with the spread of rice culture. Rattus hoxaensis from C Vietnam , described by Dao (1960) , probably represents R. argentiventer .
Rattus annandalei (Bonhote, 1903) . In Annandale, Fasciculi Malayenses, Zool., pt. 1:30 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia (Malay Peninsula), S Perak , Sungkei . DISTRIBUTION: Malay Peninsula, Singapore , E Sumatra, and islands of Padang and Rupat off the coast of E Sumatra (see Musser and Newcomb, 1983:515 , and references therein). SYNONYMS: bullatus , villosus . COMMENTS: A Sundaic endemic; superficially resembles Sundamys muelleri and some species of Rattus in primitive external, cranial, and dental features, but in other specialized traits R. annandalei is unlike any species of Sundamys and may even eventually be removed from Rattus ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ) .
Rattus baluensis (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:454 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah (N Borneo), Gunung Kinabalu, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from 7000- 12,500 ft on slopes of Gunung Kinabalu, N Borneo (Musser, 1986). COMMENTS: Taxonomic history of past, and incorrect, association of baluensis with Rattus rattus was documented by Musser (1986), who also noted that its closest relative is probably R. tiomanicus , which occurs in lowlands of Borneo and on many islands of the Sunda Shelf.
Pseudomys nanus (Gould, 1858) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1858:242 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , Victoria Plains (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:177 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; W coast of Western Australia (also Barrow Isl), between Port Hedland and the Barkly Tableland in NE Western Australia , N Northern Territory , and NW Queensland (also South-West Isl in Gulf of Carpentaria); see map in Watts and Aslin (1981:177) . SYNONYMS: ferculinus . COMMENTS: A close relative of P. gracilicaudatus to the exclusion of other species of Pseudomys , judged by analyses of electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1977 a, 1981 ); but a member of the group that includes only P. australis , P. gouldii , and P. higginsi , a conclusion based on phallic morphology ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ); but not a distinctive relative to most other species in the genus as judged by spermatozoal form (Breed, 1983).
Pseudomys laborifex Kitchener and Humphreys, 1986 . Rec. West. Aust . Mus., 12:420 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , N Western Australia , Kimberley Region, Mitchell Plateau, adjacent to Camp Creek, 270 m ( Kitchener and Humphreys, 1986:421 , provided more information, including description of habitat at type locality) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , N Western Australia and N Northern Territory (see maps in Kitchener and Humphreys, 1986:430 , 1987:292). SYNONYMS: calabyi . COMMENTS: Kitchener and Humphreys (1987) proposed calabyi as a subspecies.
Pseudomys johnsoni Kitchener, 1985 . Rec. West. Aust . Mus., 12:208 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , C Northern Territory , Kurundi Station, Kurinelli Mine, 150 m (Kitchener, 1985, provided additional information) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; known only from small area in arid C Northern Territory (see map in Kitchener, 1985:216). COMMENTS: Closest phylogenetic relative is apparently P. chapmani , which occurs in NW Western Australia (Kitchener, 1985).
Pseudomys hermannsburgensis (Waite, 1896) . Rept. Horn Sci. Exped. Cent . Aust ., Zool., 2:405 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , George Gill Range (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:176 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; arid parts of Western Australia , South Australia , Northern Territory , W Queensland , W New South Wales , and NW Victoria (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:190 ). SYNONYMS: brazenori. COMMENTS: Electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) and spermatozoal morphology (Breed, 1983) indicated P. hermannsburgensis is clustered with most other species in Pseudomys , but phallic morphology interpreted by Lidicker and Brylski (1987) as indicating closer affinity to species they place in Leggadina.
Pseudomys gracilicaudatus (Gould, 1845) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1845:77 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Darling Downs, Oakey Creek . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; modern range along the eastern coast from Townsville in N Queensland to Sydney area in New South Wales ; subfossil specimens from farther south in New South Wales ( Mahoney and Posamentier, 1975 ) and from S Victoria (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:180 ). SYNONYMS: ultra. COMMENTS: Phylogenetically closely related to P. nanus , an estimate based on spermatozoal morphology (Breed, 1983), electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1977 a, 1981 ), and morphology of skin, skull, and teeth ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ).
Pseudomys higginsi (Trouessart, 1897) . Cat. Mamm. Viv. Foss., 1:473 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Tasmania , Kentishbury . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; extant population known only from Tasmania ; represented on mainland in Victoria and E New South Wales by Late Pleistocene samples ( Wakefield, 1972b ). SYNONYMS: australiensis, leucopus (of Higgins and Petterd, 1881, not Rafinesque, 1818). COMMENTS: Spermatozoal morphology (Breed, 1983) and electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) placed P. higginsi with most other species of Pseudomys , but phallic anatomy ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ) clustered P. higginsi with P. australis , P. gouldii , and P. nanus . Wakefield (1972b) described australiensis as a subspecies based on Late Pleistocene fossils.
Pseudomys novaehollandiae (Waterhouse, 1843) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1842:146 [1843]. TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , New South Wales , upper Hunter River, Yarrundi . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; Coastal region of E New South Wales , S Victoria , and N Tasmania (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:193 ). STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered. COMMENTS: External, cranial, and dental morphology, along with electrophoretic data and spermatozoal anatomy, pointed to a close relationship between P. novaehollandiae and P. pilligaensis ( Briscoe et al., 1981 ; Breed, 1983).
Pseudomys occidentalis Tate, 1951 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 97:246 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , Tambellup . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; extant range in SW Western Australia , subfossil specimens indicate species extended along S coastline to Kangaroo Isl off coast of South Australia (see map and discussion in Watts and Aslin, 1981:205 ). STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Rare. COMMENTS: Considered "rare and likely to become extinct," but range was contracting before arrival of Europeans ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:205 ). Electrophoretic data clustered P. occidentalis with all other Pseudomys analyzed except P. fumeus , P. gracilicaudatus , P. nanus , and P. shortridgei ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) .
Pseudomys patrius (Thomas and Dollman, 1909) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1908:791 [1909]. TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Mt Inkerman . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the region of the type locality. COMMENTS: Treated as a distinct species by Fox and Briscoe (1980) and Mahoney and Richardson (1988:179) , but earlier judged by Mahoney to be a synonym of P. delicatulus (see Kitchener, 1985:218).
Pseudomys oralis Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 8:621 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia ; exact place unknown, but likely located in NE New South Wales or SE Queensland ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:179 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; extant specimens from NE New South Wales and SE Queensland , but Late Pleistocene fossils are from farther south in New South Wales and E Victoria (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:170 ). STATUS: IUCN - Rare. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of P. australis (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:179 ). One of the least known and rarest of Pseudomys ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ) .
Pseudomys pilligaensis Fox and Briscoe, 1980 . Aust . Mamm., 3:112 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , New South Wales , Merriwindi State Forest, 3 km west of Pilliga-Baradine Road., Cumberdeen Road ( Fox and Briscoe, 1980 , provided additional information) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , N New South Wales , collected from a few localities within the Pilliga Scrub (see map in Fox and Briscoe, 1980:119 ). STATUS: IUCN - Indeterminate. COMMENTS: Chromosomal morphology described by Fox and Briscoe (1980) . Morphological and electrophoretic data supported a close phylogenetic relationship of P. pilligaensis to P. delicatulus and P. novaehollandiae ( Briscoe et al., 1981 ) , which was reinforced by spermatozoal morphology (Breed, 1983).
Pseudomys praeconis Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:608 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , Peron Peninsula . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , Western Australia Shark Bay region and Bernier Isl (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981: 166 ). STATUS: CITES - Appendix I; U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Rare. COMMENTS: Clustered with most other species of Pseudomys , judged by electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ).
Pseudomys desertor Troughton, 1932 . Rec. Aust . Mus., 18:293 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , "Central Australia " (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:174 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Arid regions of Australia ; Western Australia , South Australia , Northern Territory , Queensland , New South Wales , and Victoria ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:174 ). SYNONYMS: murrayensis, subrufus. COMMENTS: Spermatozoal morphology similar to P. australis and many other species of Pseudomys (Breed, 1983) . Both names listed above are unused senior synonyms of desertor and should not be used ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988: 174 ).
Pseudomys chapmani Kitchener, 1980 . Rec. West. Aust . Mus., 8:405 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , Pilbara Dist., East Hammersley Range, West Angelas Mine Site ( Kitchener, 1980 provided additional information) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , NW Western Australia ; extant specimens known only from Pilbara Dist. (see map in Kitchener, 1985:216), but distribution of pebble mounds indicated range once extended through Gascoyne to Murchison Dist. with southern limit near Mileura, northern limit the Great Sandy Desert, and eastern limit the Gibson Desert (see discussion and map in Dunlop and Pound, 1981 ). COMMENTS: This species builds pebble mounds and is sympatric with P. hermannsburgensis ( Kitchener, 1980 ) , which does not construct pebble mounds ( Dunlop and Pound, 1981 ), but phylogenetically most closely allied to P. johnsoni , another species that constructs pebble mounds (Kitchener, 1985).
Pseudomys apodemoides Finlayson, 1932 . Trans. R. Proc. Soc. S. Aust ., 56:170 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Southern Australia , Coombe . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; SE South Australia and W Victoria (Murray-Darling Basin). COMMENTS: Phylogenetic relationships are equivocal to some (see discussion in Lidicker and Brylski, 1987:635 , and references therein), but not to other workers (see preceeding account).
Pseudomys botami Troughton, 1932 . Rec. Aust . Mus., 18:292 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , South Australia , Ooldea . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , S South Australia and S Western Australia (see map in Kitchener, 1985:216). COMMENTS: Originally described by Troughton (1932a) as a subspecies of P. hermannsburgensis , but distinguished from that species and redescribed by Kitchener et al. (1984a) , who also reported sympatry of both species at Goongarrie, Western Australia .
Pseudomys delicatulus (Gould, 1842) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1842:13 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , Port Essington . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; N coastal region from near Port Hedland in Western Australia to Bundaberg area in Queensland (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:188 ). SC Papu New Guinea , Morehead region on the trans-Fly plains ( Waithman, 1979 ). SYNONYMS: mimulus , pumilus . COMMENTS: Electrophoretic data and spermatozoal morphology supported a close relationship between P. delicatulus , P. novaehollandiae , and P. pilligaensis (Breed, 1983; Briscoe et al., 1981 ).
Pseudomys australis Gray, 1832 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1832:39 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , New South Wales , SW side of Liverpool Plains . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; New South Wales , S Queensland , South Australia , and S Northern Territory ; Late Pleistocene to Recent remains from W Victoria ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ); probably extinct in New South Wales ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:172 ). SYNONYMS: auritus , flavescens , lineolatus , minnie , murinus , stirtoni . COMMENTS: Microscopic structure of hooks on sperm head reported by Flaherty and Breed (1982) . Phallic information suggested P. australis is related to P. gouldii , P. higginsi , and P. nanus , to the exclusion of other species of Pseudomys ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987:635 ) ; electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) and spermatozoal morphology (Breed, 1983) are not discordant with this association.
Pseudomys gouldii (Waterhouse, 1839) . Zool. Voy. H.M.S. "Beagle," Mammalia, 2:67 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , New South Wales , north of Hunter River (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:175 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; range based on Recent and subfossil specimens includes W Western Australia and Murray-Darling basin in E South Australia , New South Wales , and N Victoria . STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Extinct. SYNONYMS: rawlinnae. COMMENTS: For full citation and other information see Mahoney and Richardson (1988:175) . Apparently extinct ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:175 ); no live animals seen or collected since the middle 1850's ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:169 ). Phallic morphology indicated gouldii is clustered with P. australis , P. higginsi , and P. nanus ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ) .
Pseudomys fumeus Brazenor, 1934 . Mem. Nat. Mus. Melb., 8:158 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Victoria , Turton's Pass, Otway Forest . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , Victoria (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:202 ). Range during Late Pleistocene extended into E New South Wales ( Wakefield, 1972a ). STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Rare. COMMENTS: Electrophoretic data separated P. fumeus from other species of Pseudomys ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) ; phallic morphology suggested a close tie between P. fumeus , P. albocinereus , and P. shortridgei , a group for which the generic name Gyomys is available ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987:635 ); but spermatozoal structure tied P. fumeus with most other species of Pseudomys (Breed, 1983) .
Pseudomys fieldi (Waite, 1896) . Rept. Horn Sci. Exped. Cent . Aust ., Zool., 2:403 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , S Northern Territory , Alice Springs . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Extinct. COMMENTS: Still represented only by the holotype . "It is difficult to determine whether or not this represents a distinct species or a rather aberrant specimen of some other species" ( Watts and Aslin, 1981: 171 ).
Pseudomys fuscus (Thomas, 1882) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 9:413 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Tasmania . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; modern records from E New South Wales , S Victoria , and Tasmania , but Late Pleistocene-Holocene fragments indicated range once included Kangaroo Island, Carrieton, and Naracoorte in South Australia ( Archer et al., 1984 ; Pledge, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: brazenori, mordicus , wombeyensis . COMMENTS: The form fuscus and the other taxa listed above were all described and revised under Mastacomys ( Ride, 1956 ; Wakefield , 1972b ), and this genus has always been recognized as part of the Australian fauna ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ; Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ). However, chromosomal morphology ( Baverstock et al., 1977c ), Gbanding homologies ( Baverstock et al., 1983b ), electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ), and phallic morphology ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ) linked fuscus with some species of Pseudomys , and Watts et al. (1992) united fuscus with Pseudomys . Sperm head structure reported by Breed (1984) , and variation in external morphology of glans penis documented by Morrissey and Breed (1982) . Taxonomic, distributional, and biological references cataloged by Mahoney and Richardson (1988:160) .
Pseudomys glaucus Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:609 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , S Queensland . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , Murray-Darling basin in New South Wales and S Queensland ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:175 ). COMMENTS: Possibly extinct ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:175 ).
Rattus steini Rümmler, 1935 . Z. Säugetierk., 10:115 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Weyland Range, Kunupi Mt . DISTRIBUTION: Mid-montane elevations along Central Cordillera of Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea , as well as highlands along the N coast and on Huon Peninsula (see map in Taylor et al., 1982:243 ). SYNONYMS: baliemensis, forsteri, hageni, rosalinda . COMMENTS: Until Taylor et al.'s (1982) revision, the distinctness of steini was obscured by its historical allocation as a subspecies of either leucopus , mordax , ringens, ruber , or verecundus .
Rattus sikkimensis Hinton, 1919 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 26:394 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Sikkim , Pashok, 3500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: S China (incl. islands of Hong Kong and Hainan), Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Thailand (incl. Koh Klum off SE Thailand in the Gulf of Siam ), C and N Burma , NE India ( Sikkim , Darjeeling, Bhutan ), and possibly E Nepal . Not recorded on the mainland of peninsular Thailand south of Isthmus of Kra ( 10°30'N ), but occurs on four islands (Koh Tau, Koh Pangan, Koh Samui, and Koh Kra) off the coast well south of the Isthmus (see map in Musser and Heaney, 1985). SYNONYMS: hainanicus, klumensis, koratensis, kraensis, remotus , yaoshanensis. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of R. rattus (Hinton, 1919) , then listed as a synonym of R. r. brunneusculus ( Ellerman, 1961 ) . South Vietnamese samples discussed under R. sladeni ( Van Peenen et al., 1969 ) , N Vietnamese series under R. koratensis ( Dao, 1985 ), and Thai samples under R. koratensis and R. remotus (J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a) .
Rattus sanila Flannery and White, 1991 . Nat. Geog. Res. Explor., 7:102 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bismarck Arch., New Ireland , Balof, site 2 . DISTRIBUTION: Apparently endemic to New Ireland . COMMENTS: Represented only by subfossil fragments dated at 3000 before present and older, but may still occur in primary forest, which has not been adequately sampled. Flannery and White (1991) described sanila as a subspecies of R. mordax , but most of the dental measurements of sanila exceed and do not overlap those of even the largest known mordax , suggesting the former to be a separate species, which even Flannery and White acknowledged.
Rattus sordidus (Gould, 1858) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1857:242 [1858]. TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , open plains Darling Downs = locality of lectotype (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; E coast from the tip of Cape York to NE New South Wales , and some off-shore islands (see Watts and Aslin, 1981:239 ). New Guinea ; lowlands south of Central Cordillera from Dobodura in E Papua New Guinea west and north to Koembe in Irian Jaya (see map in Taylor et al., 1983:265 ). SYNONYMS: aramia, brachyrhinus , bunae, conatus , gestri, gestroi, youngi . COMMENTS: One of the two species of native Rattus in the New Guinea-Australian region that occurs on both land masses. On morphological evidence, Taylor and Horner (1973) arranged villosissimus and colletti as subspecies of R. sordidus . Later evaluations, however, based on chromosomal, biochemical, and hybridization data, suggested the three should be viewed as separate species in the same monophyletic cluster ( Baverstock et al., 1977d , 1983a , 1986), which is the way they are treated in current faunal accounts and catalogs ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981 ).
Rattus simalurensis (Miller, 1903) . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 26:458 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sumatra , Pulau Simeulue (Simalur) . DISTRIBUTION: Simalur Isl and nearby islands of Siumat, Lasia, and Babi. SYNONYMS: babi, lasiae (see Musser and Heaney, 1985). COMMENTS: The form simalurensis and its two synonyms were each listed as a separate subspecies of R. rattus by Chasen (1940) , but simalurensis is distinct from R. rattus and in morphology represents slightly larger-bodied island variants of R. tiomanicus (Musser, 1986; Musser and Califia, 1982 ; Musser and Heaney, 1985). Whether populations on Simalur islands are distinct species or insular representatives of R. tiomanicus occurring off the margin of the continental shelf will have to be determined by systematic revision of the R. tiomanicus complex.
Rattus tanezumi Temminck, 1844 In Siebold, Temminck, and Schlegel, Fauna Japonica, Arnz et Socii, Lugduni Batavorum, p. 51 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan , possibly from near Nagasaki on Kyushu Isl (see Jones and Johnson, 1965 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Apparently indigenous to SE Asia, from E Afghanistan through highlands of Nepal and N India into S and C China (incl. Hainan Isl), Korea , and mainland Indochina (incl. offshore islands) south to Isthmus of Kra; also probably native to Mergui Arch., Andaman Isls, and some of the Nicobar Isls; also in SW peninsular India . Whether native or introduced to Taiwan and Japan is unknown (but see Yosida and Harada, 1985 ). Most likely introduced to the Malay Peninsula and islands on the Sunda Shelf ( Medway and Yong, 1976 ) and nearby archipelagos just off of the Shelf, including the Mentawais ( Musser and Califia, 1982 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Certainly introduced to the Cocos-Keeling Isls ( Musser and Califia, 1982 ), the Philippines (Musser, 1977«), Sulawesi ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ), and numerous islands east through the Moluccas and Nusa Tenggara (Musser, 1970«, 1972, 1981 c) to W New Guinea ( Sody, 1941 ), and farther east through Micronesia to islands of Eniwetok and Fiji (Johnson, 1962«, b), but not to the Samoas where R. rattus occurs (Yosida et al., 1985). SYNONYMS: alangensis, amboinensis, andamanensis , argyraceus, auroreus, barussanoides, benguetensis , bhotia, brevicaudus Chakraborty, 1975 , brevicaudus Kuroda, 1952 ; brunneus , bullocki, burrulus , coloratus , dammermani , dentatus , diardii , exsul , flavipectus , flebilis , fortunatus, germaini , griseiventer, holchu, insulanus , kadanus, keelingensis, kelleri , khyensis, kramensis, lalolis , lanensis, longicaudus , lontaris, macmillani , makassarius, makensis, mansorius, masaretes , mesanis, mindanensis , moheius, molliculus , moluccarius, neglectus , nezumi, obiensis , ouangthomae , palelae , palembang, panjius, pannellus, pannosus , pelengensis, pipidonis, poenitentiarii, portus, povolnyi, pulliventer , rangensis, robiginosus , robonsoni, robustulus , samati, santalum, sapoensis , septicus, sladeni , sumbae, tablasi, talaudensis, tatkonensis, thai , tikos, tistae, toxi , turbidus, yeni, yunnanensis , wroughtoni , zamboangae (see Ellerman, 1941 ; Ellerman and MorrisonScott, 1951; Johnson, 1962b ; Jones and Johnson, 1965 ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Musser, 1970«, 1972, 1977«; Musser and Califia, 1982 ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 , 1985; Sody, 1941 ). COMMENTS: The authority is usually cited as 1845, but was published in 1844; see Holthuis and Sakai (1970) . The name tanezumi is the oldest for the 2N=42 group of Asian houserats that is distinguished from the 2N =38 /40 R. rattus not only by chromosomal characters but also by morphological and biochemical traits (see account of R. rattus ). The indigenous range is generally north and east of peninsular India , but in Mysore State of SW India , the two chromosomal types ( wroughtoni , 2N=42, and rufescens , 2N=38) occur together ( Lakhotia et al., 1973 ; Niethammer, 1975). Nature of the specific relationship between R. rattus and R. tanezumi on the Indian subcontinent where indigenous ranges are either parapatric or overlap still requires resolution. Phallic morphology of Chinese flavipectus described by Yang and Fang (1988) in context of assessing phylogenetic relationships among Chinese murines.
Rattus stoicus (Miller, 1902) . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 24:759 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Andaman Isls, Henry Lawrence Isl . DISTRIBUTION: The islands of Henry Lawrence, Little Andaman, and South Andaman in the Andaman Arch. ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). SYNONYMS: rogersi , taciturnus (see Musser and Heaney, 1985). COMMENTS: Despite past confusion with Sundamys muelleri , R. stoicus is defined by a unique set of derived and primitive features, and is endemic to the Andaman Isls. ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Its closest phylogenetic ally has yet to be determined (Musser, 1986).
Rattus pelurus Sody, 1941 . Treubia, 18:308 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Kepulauan Banggai, Pulau Peleng ( 1°23'S , 123°14'E ), east of Sulawesi . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Peleng Isl. COMMENTS: Originally described by Sody as a subspecies of R. foramineus , but provisionally treated as an insular population of R. xanthurus by Musser (1984) , and finally reviewed as a distinctive species by Musser and Holden (1991) , who also placed it in the R. xanthurus group.
Rattus palmarum (Zelebor, 1869) . Reise Oesterr. Fregatte Novara. Zool., (Wirbelthiere), Säugeth., p. 26 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Nicobar Isis, probably Carr Nicobar (Dr. K. Bauer, Naturhistorisches Museum Wien, in litt.) . DISTRIBUTION: Nicobar Isis, probably Carr Nicobar. SYNONYMS: novarae , palmarum . COMMENTS: Known only by the few specimens in the original series. A distinctive species (Musser and Heaney, 1985; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ) that may be related to the R. tiomanicus complex (Musser, 1986) . Both synonyms are Fitzinger names dating from 1861 and are nomina nuda (see Miller, 1902:759 ).
Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769) . Outlines of the Natural History of Great Britain and Ireland , 1:5 . TYPE LOCALITY: Great Britain . DISTRIBUTION: Original distribution assumed to be SE Siberia and N China ( Heilongjiang ), but introduced worldwide where it is more common in colder climates of high latitudes ( Kucheruk, 1990 ); in warmer regions and tropics restricted to habitats highly modified by humans—sewers, buildings, wharves, and breakwaters, for example ( Johnson, 1962a ). SYNONYMS: norvegicus var. albus , caraco , caspius , cauquenensis, decaryi, decumanoides (nomen nudum ), decumanus , discolor , griseipectus , hibernicus , hoffmanni (Trouessart, 1904, not Matschie, 1901), humiliatus , hybridus, insolatus , javanus , leucosternum, lutescens , magnirostris , decumanus var. major , maniculatus , norvegicus var. orii , norvegicus var. otomoi , plumbeus , praestans, primarius, simpsoni ( Philippi, 1900 , not Ellerman, 1949), socer, sowerbyi , surmulottus, tamarensis (see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Jones and Johnson, 1965 ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; Musser, 1977a ; Musser and Newcomb, 1985 ; Sody, 1941 ; and Osgood, 1943 ). COMMENTS: Geographic variation among presumably native Chinese populations reported by Wu (1982) . Samples from native Asian, free-living introduced, and laboratory populations were the subjects of numerous morphological (e.g., Bugge, 1970 ; Greene, 1935 ), physiological, chromosomal and molecular (many are summarized in Yosida, 1980 , and Levan et al., 1990 ) studies, which have produced among the mass of data a gene map of R. norvegicus ( Levan et al., 1990 ) , and results of attempted hybridizations between R. norvegicus and different forms of R. rattus (summarized by Yosida, 1980 ). Review of European populations provided by Becker (1978b) ; overall review of systematics reported by Milyutin (1990) . Phylogenetic relationships to other members of subgenus Rattus equivocal (e.g., contrast Chan et al., 1979 , with Pasteur et al., 1982 ), but morphological and biochemical data indicate significant phylogenetic divergence between R. norvegicus and R. rattus ( Baverstock et al., 1983 a, b, 1986 ; Chan, 1977 ). Phallic morphology of Chinese samples described by Yang and Fang (1988) in context of assessing phylogenetic relationships among Chinese murines.
Rattus osgoodi Musser and Newcomb, 1985 . Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 2814:18 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Vietnam , Tuyen Due Prov., Langbian Peak, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Highlands ( 3000-6000 ft ) of southern Vietnam . COMMENTS: Morphologically and probably phylogenetically related to R. losea .
Rattus novaeguineae Taylor and Calaby, 1982 . In Taylor et al., Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 173:259 TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Kalolo Creek, 1070 m . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Papua New Guinea "from Kassam westward to Karimui in the north, and southward to Koranga, at altitudes ranging from 740 to 1525 m " ( Taylor et al., 1982:259 ; see map on p. 258).
Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758) . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:61 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sweden , Uppsala County , Uppsala . DISTRIBUTION: Native to Indian Peninsula, and introduced worldwide in the tropics and temperate zone ( Becker, 1978a ; de Roguin, 1991 ; Dieterlen, 1979; Duplantier et al., 19916; Johnson, 1962a , b; Niethammer, 1975; Taylor and Horner, 1973 ; Taylor et al., 1982 ; Twigg, 1992 ; Yosida, 1980 ; Yosida et al., 1985). SYNONYMS: aethiops, albiventer , albus, alexandrino-rattus, alexandrinus , arboreus , arboricola , asiaticus , ater , atratus , atridorsum , auratus , beccarii , brookei , brunneusculus , caeruleus, ceylonus , chionogaster , coquimbensis, crassipes , cyaneus, doboensis, domesticus , doriae, erythronotus , flavescens , flaviventris , frugivorus , fuliginosus , fulvaster, fuscus , gangutrianus, girensis, griseocaeruleus , indicus (Desmarest, 1822, not Bechstein, 1800), infralineatus (nomen nudum ), intermedius , jujensis , jurassicus, kandianus , kandiyanus , kelaarti , kijabius , latipes , leucogaster , muansae , narbadae, nemoralis , nericola, osorninus, picteti , rattiformis, rattoides , rufescens , ruthenus, saltuum, samharensis , satarae , siculae , subcaeruleus , subrufus, sueirensis, sylvestris , tectorum , tetragonurus , tettensis, tompsoni , variabilis , varius (see Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; Osgood, 1943 ; Schütter and Thonglongya, 1971; Taylor et al., 1982 ). COMMENTS: Numerous cytogenetic studies focusing on the R. rattus complex, summarized by Baverstock et al. (1983c) , Bekasova and Mezhova (1983) , Niethammer (1975), and Yosida (1980) , have revealed the complex to consist of two basic groups of populations. The Oceanian or European type has 2N=38 ( 40 in some), the Asian type is characterized by 2N=42; the two are also distinguished by biochemical features ( Baverstock et al., 1983c ) as well as morphological traits ( Schwabe, 1979 ). Where the Asian type is indigenous, the Oceanian form is restricted to ports or on ships in harbor. Both chromosomal kinds apparently occur together without evidence of interbreeding on the Polynesian island of Fiji (Yosida et al., 1985), but do hybridize in the laboratory (usually producing sterile offspring) and on the South Pacific islands of Chichijima and Eniwetok (with apparent introgression). The biological status of the two kinds were best summarized by Baverstock et al. (1983c:978) , who noted that if "the chromosomal, electrophoretic and laboratory hybridization data are considered together, it seems that the 2n=38 and 2n=42 forms are best considered as incipient species. Where they meet, they may introgress, become sympatric without interbreeding or one may replace the other depending upon the prevailing biological conditions," a view earlier espoused by Capanna (1974) . Rattus rattus is the name for the 2N=38 /40 group, and we list it as a species separate from the 2N=42 form, for which the oldest name is R. tanezumi (see that account).
Rattus ranjiniae Agrawal and Ghosal, 1969 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Calcutta, 22:41 . TYPE LOCALITY: SW Indian Peninsula, India , Kerala State , Trivandrum . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality and Trichur, also in Kerala . COMMENTS: Represented by the four specimens taken at the type locality and two others collected at Trichur. Most information about the species is meager and contained in the original description. Our study of two paratypes kindly loaned to us by Dr. S. Chakraborty revealed that R. ranjiniae is characterized by large claws relative to body size, very long and slender hind feet, large body size, long molar rows, small bullae, narrow incisive foramina, and a short bony palate that does not extend past the third molars. These traits combine in a morphology that is uniquely distinct compared with all other species now placed in Rattus . Phylogenetic relationships of ranjiniae are unknown; possibly this species should be removed from Rattus .
Rattus praetor (Thomas, 1888) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 2:158 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Guadalcanal Isl, Aola . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; on the mainland found from Vogelkop throughout both sides of Central Cordillera in Irian Jaya and lowlands of N New Guinea to about the Sepik-Ramu drainage. Also occurs on Admiralty and Solomon Isis and in the Bismarck Arch, on Umboi, New Britain, and New Ireland ( Flannery and White, 1991 ; Taylor et al., 1982 ). SYNONYMS: bandiculus , coenorum , mediocris , purdiensis , sansapor , tramitius, utakwa. COMMENTS: In Tate's (1951) monograph, this species was listed as a subspecies of R. ruber ; the holotype of ruber is an example of the introduced R. nitidus ( Taylor et al., 1983 , summarized the taxonomic history).
Rattus macleari (Thomas, 1887) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1887:513 . TYPE LOCALITY: Christmas Isl ( Australia ) . DISTRIBUTION: Was endemic to Christmas Isl, 320 km south of Java in the Indian Ocean, but was thought to be extinct by 1908 ( Andrews, 1909 ) and is now considered extinct ( Flannery, 1990c ). COMMENTS: Ellerman (1941) first listed the species as the only member of " macleari " group in subgenus Rattus , then placed it and R. nativitatis in same group within subgenus Stenomys of Rattus ( Ellerman, 1949a ). Chasen (1940) thought macleari to be nearest Sundamys muelleri , but in their comparisons, Musser and Newcomb (1983) found no support for this alliance. Misonne (1969) included macleari in subgenus Rattus. Sody (1941) proposed genus Christomys for macleari. In the original description, Thomas (1887c) indicated macleari to belong to a group that included celebensis, everetti, meyeri, and xanthurus; of these, only xanthurus resembled macleari ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved, but Musser (1986) suggested macleari should be compared with a group of species that includes annandalei, enganus, korinchi, montanus, nativitatis, and xanthurus, all not part of subgenus Rattus, and distantly related to it.
Rattus lutreolus (J. E. Gray, 1841) . In G. Gray, App. C in Jour. Two Exped. Aust ., 11:409 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , New South Wales , Hunter River, Moscheto Isl (locality of lectotype ; see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Tasmania ; coastal and subcoastal habitats from vicinity of Adelaide in SE South Australia east and north through Victoria , New South Wales to SE Queensland ; isolated populations occur in N Queensland (see maps in Taylor and Horner, 1973:53 , and Watts and Aslin, 1981:231 ). SYNONYMS: cambricus, imbil, lacus , pachyurus , petterdi, tetragonurus , vellerosus , velutinus . COMMENTS: Watts and Aslin (1981) provided a comprehensive discussion of the species. See Taylor and Calaby (1988b , Mammalian Species, 299).
Rattus marmosurus Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 7:246 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , NE Sulawesi , Minahassa, Gunung Masarang, 2000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: NE Sulawesi only, from vicinity of Teluk Kuandang ( 0°50'N , 122°52'E ) east to Gunung Klabat ( 1°28'N , 125°02'E ). SYNONYMS: tondanus . COMMENTS: Although marmosurus has been listed as a subspecies of R. xanthurus ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ), most researchers besides Thomas have recognized its specific uniqueness ( Misonne, 1969 ; Musser, 1971c , 1984; Musser and Holden, 1991 ; Sody, 1941 ; Tate, 1936). Furthermore, the two are sympatric in NE Sulawesi ( Musser, 1971c ). Sody (1941) questionably included marmosurus in Taeromys , but it is a member of the Rattus xanthurus group. Musser (1971e) explained why tondanus is a synonym.
Rattus mollicomulus Tate and Archbold, 1935 . Am. Mus. Novit., 802:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , SW Sulawesi , Gunung Lampobatang, Wawokaraeng, 1500 m . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the upper slopes of Gunung Lampobatang, Sulawesi; distribution is concordant with Paruromys ursinus ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ) . COMMENTS: Morphological and distributional limits outlined by Musser and Holden (1991) , who also provided a history of past allocations of the name. Closest relative is R. hoffmanni , which occurs in lowlands of the SW peninsula and throughout the rest of Sulawesi .
Rattus mindorensis (Thomas, 1898) . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 14:402 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Mindoro Isl, Mt Dulangan, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Highlands of Mindoro ( Philippines ). SYNONYMS: picinus. COMMENTS: Phylogenetically distant from other species of Rattus native to the Philippines ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). Morphologically closely related to Rattus tiomanicus , which is native to Malay Peninsula and islands on the Sunda Shelf, and possibly only an insular variant of that species ( Musser and Califia, 1982 ; Musser and Heaney, 1985). Musser (1977b) explained why picinus is a synonym.
Rattus mordax (Thomas, 1904) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 14:398 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Kumusi River (see Tate, 1951:333 , for comments) . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; Huon Peninsula and both sides of Owen Stanley Range on mainland. Also found in the d'Entrecasteaux Isl, the Louisiade Arch., and Woodlark Isl in the Trobriand Isis (see map in Taylor et al., 1982:225 ). SYNONYMS: fergussoniensis . COMMENTS: Originally described by Thomas as a species, mordax has been historically treated as a subspecies of either leucopus , ringens, or ruber until it was reinstated by Taylor et al. (1982) .
Rattus nativitatis (Thomas, 1889) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1888:533 [1889]. TYPE LOCALITY: Christmas Isl ( Australia ) . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Christmas Isl, 320 km south of Java in the Indian Ocean; suspected to be extinct by 1908 ( Andrews, 1909 ) and is now considered extinct ( Flannery, 1990c ). COMMENTS: For Thomas (1888b) , the morphology of R. nativitatis distanced it from any other described species of Rattus . Ellerman (1941) first listed the species as the only member of the " nativitatis " group in subgenus Rattus , then placed it and R. macleari in same group within subgenus Stenomys of Rattus ( Ellerman, 1949a ) . Chasen (1940) thought R. nativitatis to be without close relatives in Malaysia , but Misonne (1969) placed it close to rajah in the subgenus Leopoldamys of Rattus , an allocation rejected by Musser (1981 b) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) . Three hypotheses about phylogenetic position of R. nativitatis require testing: 1. It is more closely related to R. macleari , the other endemic on Christmas Island than to any other species of Rattus ; 2. It is not related to R. macleari but to other species in the genus or is phylogenetically isolated; 3. It is not even a member of Rattus.
Rattus morotaiensis Kellogg, 1945 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 58:66 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Moluccas , Pulau Morotai, off N coast of Pulau Halmahera . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Morotai Isl but probably occurs on Halmahara and nearby islands. COMMENTS: A distinctive species probably related to native Rattus of New Guinea .
Rattus nitidus (Hodgson, 1845) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 15:267 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nepal . DISTRIBUTION: Records on mainland Southeast Asia are from S China (including Hainan Isl), Vietnam , Laos , N Thailand , Burma , India ( Assam , Bhutan , Sikkim, and Kumaun), Bangladesh , and Nepal ; these probably represent the indigenous range. Records east of the continental shelf are from Sulawesi, Luzon Isl in the Philippines , Seram Isl in the Moluccas , the Vogelkop Peninsula of Irian Jaya , and the Palau isls; this range likely represents introductions mediated by human agency ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: aequicaudalus, guhai , horeites , manuselae , obsoletus, rahengis , ruber , rubricosa , subditivus, vanheurni (see Ellerman, 1941 ; Khajuria et al., 1977 ; J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a, b; Musser, 1981c ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ; and Taylor et al., 1982 ). COMMENTS: Ellerman (1941) listed pyctoris as a synonym of R. nitidus , but that name was based on a specimen of R. turkestanicus . Phallic morphology described by Yang and Fang (1988) in context of assessing phylogenetic relationships among Chinese murines.
Rattus montanus Phillips, 1932 . Ceylon J. Sci., Sec. B, 16:323 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sri Lanka ( Ceylon ), West Haputale, Ohiya, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality, Horton Plains at 7000 ft , and Nuwara Eliya at 6000 ft in primary montane forests of Central and Uva Provinces of Sri Lanka ( Phillips, 1980 ). COMMENTS: A montane endemic on Sri Lanka and morphologically so unlike most other species of Rattus it may not belong in same genus, despite assertion of one author that it is nothing more than a large form of R. rattus (see Musser, 1986:22). Like R. annandalei , R. hoogerwerfi , R. korinchi , R. macleari , R. nativitatis , and members of the R. xanthurus group, the Ceylon endemic seems isolated within present morphological boundaries of Rattus (Musser, 1986) .
Rattus jobiensis Riimmler, 1935 . Z. Säugetierk., 10:116 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Pulay Yapen (Japen Isl) in Teluk Cendrawasih (Geelvinck Bay) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, recorded only from islands of Yapen, Owi, and Biak in Geelvinck Bay (see map in Taylor et al., 1982:262 ). SYNONYMS: biakensis , owiensis . COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of R. leucopus , jobiensis is a distinctive species that may be more closely related to Moluccan endemics than to native mainland New Guinea species of Rattus ( Taylor et al., 1982 ) .
Rattus hoogerwerfi Chasen, 1939 . Treubia, 17(3):496 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Sumatra , Aceh , Gunung Leuser, Blang Kedjeren, 2900 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from between 2900 and 9300 ft in foothills and upper slopes of Gunung Leuser, Sumatra (see map in Musser, 1986). COMMENTS: Very distinctive and possibly not a member of Rattus . Morphology and comparisons with other species documented by Musser and Newcomb (1983) and Musser (1986). Although phylogenetic affinities with species of Rattus from Sulawesi, the Philippines , and Christmas Island have been claimed by Miller (1942) , and with R. korinchi by Chasen (1939) , no compelling evidence links R. hoogerwerfi with any other species (Musser, 1986).
Rattus giluwensis Hill, 1960 . J. Mammal., 41:277 . TYPE LOCALITY: NE New Guinea , Papua, Mt Giluwe, 11,000 -12,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Mt Giluwe, Papua New Guinea and adjoining highlands between 2195 and 3660 m (see map in Taylor et al., 1982 ). STATUS: IUCN - Rare. COMMENTS: Originally described as R. ruber melanurus by Laurie and Hill (1954:112) , but the name is preoccupied by Rattus melanurus Shamel, 1940 , which refers to a sample of Maxomys whiteheadi . A morphologically distinctive species whose phylogenetic affinities seem equivocal ( Taylor et al., 1982 , 1983 ).
Rattus hoffmanni (Matschie, 1901) . Abh. Senckenb. Naturforsch. Ges., 25:284 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , NE Sulawesi , Minahassa . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; throughout island except upper slopes of Gunung Lampobatang at the end of the SW peninsula (distribution is concordant with that of Paruromys dominator ); also on Pulau Malenge in Kepulauan Togian ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: biformatus , celebensis (of Hoffmann, 1887, not Gray, 1867), linduensis, mengkoka, mollicomus , tatei (see Musser, 1971b ). COMMENTS: Morphological, chromosomal, distributional, and ecological boundaries of species elaborated by Musser and Holden (1991) , who also documented taxonomic history. Closest relative of R. hoffmanni is R. mollicomulus from Gunung Lampobatang, Sulawesi; both form the monophyletic Rattus hoffmanni group. Phylogenetic affinities of this group to other species of Rattus is unresolved.
Rattus hainaldi Kitchener, How, and Maharadatunkamsi, 1991 . Rec. West. Aust . Mus., 15:557 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara , Pulau Flores, Gunung Ranakah, 1300 m, above Kampong Robo, Desa Longko, 8 km SSE Ruteng . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Flores Isl. COMMENTS: Represented by two specimens ( Kitchener et al., 1991c ). Phylogenetic affinities uncertain, possibly allied to native Australian and New Guinea species of Rattus .
Rattus losea (Swinhoe, 1871) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1870:637 (1871). TYPE LOCALITY: Taiwan . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Taiwan , Pescadores Isis, S China (Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hainan Isl), C Vietnam , S Laos , and Thailand (excluding peninsular Thailand ); probably will also be found in Cambodia , N Laos and Vietnam , and parts of Burma borderingThailand ( Musser and Newcomb, 1985 ). SYNONYMS: exiguus , sakeratensis . COMMENTS: Known morphological, geographical, and altitudinal boundaries; correctly and incorrectly assoicated scientific names; and geographic variation reviewed by Musser and Newcomb (1985) . They also suggested that R. losea is morphologically and probably phylogenetically nearer R. osgoodi from the highlands of S Vietnam than any other species of Rattus , and speculated that R. losea is also phylogenetically linked to R. argentiventer .
Rattus lugens (Miller, 1903) . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 45:33 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Kepulauan Mentawai, Pulau Utara Pagai (North Pagai Isl) . DISTRIBUTION: Islands of Siberut, Sipora, Pagai Utara, and Pagai Selattan in the Mentawai Archipelago off coast of SW Sumatra ; these islands lie on a slender peninsula of the continental shelf. SYNONYMS: mentawai. COMMENTS: Chasen (1940) listed lugens and mentawai each as a subspecies of R. rattus , but the Mentawai endemic is a morphologically distinctive species closely related to R. adustus from Enggano Isl, and to the R. tiomanicus complex (Musser, 1986; Musser and Califia, 1982 ; Musser and Heaney, 1985). Part of the rodent fauna endemic to Mentawi Archipelago (see account of Leopoldamys siporanus ).
Rattus koopmani Musser and Holden, 1991 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 206:389 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Kepulauan Banggai, Pulau Peleng ( 1 °23'S , 123°14'E ), which is separated from mainland Sulawesi by deepwater Selat Peleng . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Peleng Isl. COMMENTS: Represented only by the holotype . In some characters, R. koopmani resembles the Sulawesian R. hoffmanni , but it also shares other traits with R. elaphinus from Taliabu Isl to the east of Peleng Isl. More specimens are needed to assess morphological variation ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ) and better estimate phylogenetic affinity.
Rattus leucopus (Gray, 1867) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1867:598 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Cape York = Locality of lectotype (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:183 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , Queensland ; one population ranges from the tip of Cape York south down the E side of the Peninsula to the vicinity of Coen, another from the region of Cooktown south along the coast to Tully; all records are east of the Great Dividing Range (see maps in Taylor and Horner, 1973:43 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). New Guinea ; widespread in lowlands south of Central Cordillera, and in N and S lowland regions fringing the Owen Stanley Range (see map in Taylor et al., 1982:232 ). SYNONYMS: cooktownensis, dobodurae, mcilwraithi, personata , ratticolor, ringens, terra-reginae . COMMENTS: This species and R. sordidus are the only two native Rattus occurring on both New Guinea and the NE coastal region of Australia ( Taylor et al., 1982 ). Morphologically related to other species of Rattus native to New Guinea ( Taylor et al., 1982 ). Morphological data interpreted by Taylor and Horner (1973) to indicate close affiliation between R. leucopus and R. fuscipes from coastal Queensland; genic data discordant with this view ( Baverstock et al., 1983a , 1986).
Rattus korinchi (Robinson and Kloss, 1916) . J. Str. Br. Roy. Asiatic Soc., 73:275 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Sumatra , Propinsi Jambi , Gunung Kerinci, Sungai Kring, 7300 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Gunung Kerinci and Gunung Talakmau in W Sumatra (see map in Musser, 1986:4). COMMENTS: Revised by Musser (1986). Known by very few specimens, and morphologically unlike any other described species of Rattus .
Notomys alexis Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:316 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , 35 miles SW of Alroy, 800 ft (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:166 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; Western Australia , Northern Territory , South Australia , and W Queensland (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:109 ). SYNONYMS: everardensis, reginae. COMMENTS: Of all the species of Notomys , N. alexis has the most extensive geographic range ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). Variation in sperm head morphology documented by Breed and Sarafis (1983) .
Niviventer rapit (Bonhote, 1903) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 11:123 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah (N Borneo), Gunung Kinabalu . DISTRIBUTION: Cameron Highlands of Malay Peninsula, mountains of Sumatra , and highlands of N Borneo. SYNONYMS: atchinensis, cameroni , fraternus . COMMENTS: Reviewed and contrasted with other species of Niviventer by Musser (1981b) . The hypothesis that only one species is involved in such a disjunct insular distribution requires evaluation in context of systematic revision of Niviventer .
Niviventer niviventer (Hodgson, 1836) . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 5:234 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nepal , Katmandu . DISTRIBUTION: NE Pakistan , Nepal , and N India (Punjab, Kumaon, Darjeeling, Sikkim ). SYNONYMS: lepcha , monticola , niveiventer. COMMENTS: Nature of relationship of N. niviventer with N. confucianus to the east requires resolution in context of systematic revision of the genus, but to date "there is yet no convincing evidence that the Nepalese populations are the same as those from areas farther east in northern Burma and China " ( Musser, 1981 b:253 ) or from N Thailand ( Abe, 1983:160 ).
Niviventer tenaster (Thomas, 1916) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 17:425 . TYPE LOCALITY: Burma (Tenasserim), Mt Mulaiyit, 5000-6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Mountains of Assam ( India ), S Burma (also possibly N Burma ), and Vietnam . SYNONYMS: champa. COMMENTS: A large-bodied species that is sympatric with what has been identified as either N. bukit or N. fulvescens ( Musser, 1981b ) . Samples from N Burma , which Musser provisionally referred to as N. coxingi , are not that species and are similar in morphology to N. tenaster , but larger in body size and darker in fur coloration. To determine whether the N Burma population is a separate species or a geographic variant of N. tenaster , and the nature of the relationship of all these highland Indochinese populations with the large-bodied N. coxingi of Taiwan , will have to be resolved by careful systematic revision ( Musser, 1981b ). Robinson and Kloss (1922) described champa as a subspecies of Rattus bukit .
Notomys Lesson, 1842 . Nouv. Tabi. Regne Anim. Mammifères, p. 129 . TYPE SPECIES: Dipus mitchellii Ogilby, 1838 . SYNONYMS: Ascopharynx , Podanomalus , Thylacomys . COMMENTS: Member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c:167 ), which includes the Conilurini where Baverstock (1984) placed Notomys . Gross and microscopical anatomy of neck glands described by Watts (1975) ; morphological variation in female reproductive tract documented by Breed (1985) ; morphology of male reproductive tract, glans penis, and spermatozoa described by Breed (1980 , 1984 , 1986), Breed and Sarafis (1978) , and Morrissey and Breed (1982) ; results of electrophoretic studies presented by Baverstock et al. (1977b , 1981); chromosomal evolution and G-banding homologies addressed by Baverstock et al. (1977 c, e, 1983b ). Mahoney and Richardson (1988) cataloged references to taxonomy, distribution, and biology of the species. Members of Notomys form a monophyletic group diagnosed by a suite of distinctive morphological and genic traits; closest phylogenetic relatives are species of Pseudomys (see Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 , and references therein; Watts et al., 1992 ).
Notomys mordax Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:317 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Darling Downs . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Extinct. COMMENTS: Still represented only by the the skull of the holotype ( Mahoney, 1977 ). Apparently extinct ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ; Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ). Mahoney (1977) considered N. mordax to be closely related to N. mitchellii ; Watts and Aslin (1981: 121) claimed that "it is not possible to be sure that this one skull really represents a distinct species, or whether it is simply that of a large specimen of Mitchell's hopping-mouse."
Notomys longicaudatus (Gould, 1844) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1844:104 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , Moore River . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; Western Australia and Northern Territory (see Watts and Aslin, 1981:107 ). STATUS: IUCN - Extinct. SYNONYMS: sturti . COMMENTS: No living animals have either been seen or trapped since 1901, and the species is apparently extinct ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). Male reproductive anatomy and spermatozoal morphology is described by Breed (1990) .
Notomys fuscus (Jones, 1925) . Rec. S. Aust . Mus., 3:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , South Australia , Ooldea Dist . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; SE Western Australia , S Northern Territory , South Australia , and SW Queensland (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:115 ). Also in W New South Wales (Watts, in litt.). STATUS: IUCN - Vulnerable. SYNONYMS: eyreius, filmeri .
Notomys macrotis Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 8:538 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , Moore River . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Extinct. SYNONYMS: megalotis . COMMENTS: Represented only by the holotype and paratype from " Australia " (Mahoney, 1975). Apparently extinct. Closest phylogenetic relative is probably Notomys cervinus (Mahoney, 1975) .
Notomys mitchellii (Ogilby, 1838) . Lond. Edinb. Philos. Mag. J. Sci., 12:96 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Victoria , about 12 km southeast of Lake Boga (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:169 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; S Western Australia , S South Australia , and W Victoria (see map and discussion in Watts and Aslin, 1981:118 ); once occurred in SW New South Wales , but is now apparently extinct there ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:170 ). SYNONYMS: alutacea, gouldi , macropus , richardsonii .
Notomys amplus Brazenor, 1936 . Mem. Nat. Mus. Melb., 9:7 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , Charlotte Waters . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; S Northern Territory and N South Australia (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:104 ). STATUS: IUCN - Extinct. COMMENTS: Known by only two extant specimens from the type locality ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ) and a skin collected during the last cenruty from Burt Plain near Alice Springs (in the Australian Museum, Flannery, in litt.), but also represented by owl pellet deposits from Flinders Ranges of South Australia ; apparently extinct ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ; Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ).
Notomys aquilo Thomas, 1921 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 8:540 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Cape York . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; N Queensland and N Northern Territory (Groot Eylandt and N Arnhem Land); see map in Watts and Aslin (1981:113) . STATUS: U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Insufficiently known. SYNONYMS: carpentarius . COMMENTS: Apparently found only in coastal sand ridges around Gulf of Carpentaria.
Notomys cervinus (Gould, 1853) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1851: 127 [1853]. TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , "Interior of South Australia ." DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; SW Queensland , South Australia , and S Northern Territory (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:99 ). SYNONYMS: aistoni . COMMENTS: For date of publication see Mahoney and Richardson (1988:167) .
Niviventer culturatus (Thomas, 1917) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 20:198 . TYPE LOCALITY: Taiwan , Mt Arizan, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to mountains of Taiwan . COMMENTS: Either listed as a species ( Ellerman, 1941 ), a subspecies of N. niviventer ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Wang and Zheng, 1981 ), or included in N. confucianus ( Musser, 1981b ) . It is a distinctive insular form that in morphology resembles mainland N. confucianus , but differs sufficiently that it should be treated as a species until relationships can be assessed by systematic revision of the genus.
Niviventer andersoni (Thomas, 1911) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1911(90):4 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Sichuan , Omi San, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: China (SE Tibet , Yunnan , Sichuan , and Shaanxi ). COMMENTS: Reviewed and contrasted with N. excelsior and N. confucianus by Musser and Chiu (1979) . Closest relative is Niviventer excelsior ; the two species are set apart from other species of Niviventer by primitive traits they share, and both are isolated in the high mountains of W China ( Musser, 1981b ).
Niviventer cremoriventer (Miller, 1900) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 13:144 . TYPE LOCALITY: Thailand , Trang Prov . DISTRIBUTION: Peninsular Thailand , Malay Peninsula and offshore islands, Mergui Archipelago, Anambas Islands, Sumatra, Nias, Billiton and Banka islands, Borneo and offshore islands, Java, and Bali. SYNONYMS: barussanus , cretaceiventer, flaviventer , gilbiventer , kina , malawali, mengurus , solus , spatulatus , sumatrae. COMMENTS: Revised and discussed by Musser (1973 c, 1981b ), who also described the species as a Sundaic endemic whose closest phylogenetic relative is the Indochinese endemic, N. langbianis .
Niviventer coxingi (Swinhoe, 1864) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1864:185 . TYPE LOCALITY: Taiwan . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Taiwan . SYNONYMS: coninga . COMMENTS: Musser (1981 b) included a population from N Burma , but its relationship to other groups of large-bodied Niviventer , especially, N. coxingi , is unclear. Whether N. coxingi is an insular form of populations now found in the mountains of Indochina or is simply a large-bodied insular derivative of mainland N. fulvescens will have to be evaluated in context of critical systematic revision ( Musser, 1981b ).
Niviventer brahma (Thomas, 1914) . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 23:232 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , N Assam , Anzong Valley in Mishmi Hills, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: N Assam ( India ) and N Burma . COMMENTS: Morphological and geographic limits outlined by Musser (1970 b, 1973 a, 1981b ), who also reported that the species is represented by few specimens, and is most closely related to N. eha .
Niviventer confucianus (Milne-Edwards, 1871) . Nouv. Arch. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, 7, Bull.:93 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Szechwan, Moupin . DISTRIBUTION: N Burma , N Thailand , and highlands of China north to Jilin Prov. ; limits uncertain. SYNONYMS: canorus, chihliensis, elegans , littoreus, luticolor, mentosus , naoniuensis, sacer, sinianus, yaoshanensis, yushuensis, zappeyi . COMMENTS: Wang and Zheng (1981) reported results from a systematic study under the name of Rattus niviventer , and described yushuensis as a subspecies. Zhang and Zhao (1984) proposed naoniuensis as a subspecies. Usually included in N. niviventer , but that allocation is not supported by present evidence ( Abe, 1983 ; Musser, 1981b ). Geographic and elevational relationships between northern N. confucianus and southern N. fulvescens , especially in W and S China , needs to be resolved by careful taxonomic revision.
Niviventer eha (Wroughton, 1916) . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 24:428 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Sikkim , Lachen, 8800 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Nepal , India (Darjeeling, Sikkim , and N Assam ), N Burma , and China (N Yunnan ). SYNONYMS: ninus. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1970b) . Shared morphological traits and proportions support the hypothesis of close phylogenetic relationship between N. eha and N. brahma .
Niviventer excelsior (Thomas, 1911) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1911(90):4 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , W Sichuan , Tatsienlu, 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: China ( Sichuan ). COMMENTS: A Sichuan endemic related to and occurring sympatrically with N. andersoni ( Musser, 1981 b ; Musser and Chiu, 1979 ).
Niviventer fulvescens (Gray, 1847) . Cat. Hodgson Coll. Br. Mus., p. 18 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nepal . DISTRIBUTION: From S Himalayas ( Nepal and N India ) through Bangladesh , S China (incl. Hainan Isl), and Indochina (incl. Con Son Isl off Vietnam ) to Peninsular Thailand , Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and Bali. SYNONYMS: baturus, besuki, blythi , bukit , caudatior , cinnamomeus , condorensis, flavipilis , gracilis , huang , jacobsoni, jerdoni , lepidus , lepturoides, lieftincki, ling , lotipes, marinus, mekongis, mentosus , minor , octomammis , orbus , pan, temmincki, treubii, vulpicolor, wongi . COMMENTS: Some authors have referred to populations on the Sunda Shelf and S Indochina as bukit , and those occurring farther north as fulvescens ( Chasen, 1940 ; J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977«; Musser, 1981 b ), pending a taxonomic revision of the group. Recent study now supports the hypothesis that samples of bukit represent N. fulvescens ( Abe, 1983 ) , an arrangement reflecting the earlier view of Osgood (1932:305) : "The relationship of fulvescens to southern forms is obvious in several instances, especially in that of R. f. bukit which can at most be no more than a subspecies." This hypothesis will require testing by carful systematic revision of the fulvescens-bukit complex. Niviventer fulvescens is the only member of the genus with a geographic distribution encompassing SE Asian mainland and some islands of the Sunda Shelf; other murines with roughly equivalent ranges are Berylmys bowersii, Chiropodomys gliroides, Leopoldamys sabanus, L. edwardsi, and Maxomys surifer ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Spermatozoal morphology of Malayan bukit described by Breed and Yong (1986) in comparative context.
Niviventer lepturus (Jentink, 1879) . Notes Leyden Mus., 2: 17 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Java , Gunung Gede . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to montane forest in W and C Java . SYNONYMS: fredericae, maculipectus. COMMENTS: Reviewed and compared with other species of Niviventer by Musser (1981b) . A distinctive member of the endemic Javan murine fauna (Musser, 1986; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Niviventer langbianis (Robinson and Kloss, 1922) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:96 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Vietnam , Langbian Peak, 1800-2300 m . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from India ( Assam ), Burma , Thailand north of Isthmus of Kra, Laos , and Vietnam . SYNONYMS: indosinicus , quangninhensis, vientianensis COMMENTS: Morphological limits and comparisons with N. cremoriventer , its closest relative, were reported by Musser (1973 c, 1981b ). Dao and Cao (1990) described quangninhensis as a subspecies of Rattus cremoriventer .
Niviventer hinpoon (Marshall, 1976) . Family Muridae: rats and mice, p. 459 . Privately printed by Government Printing Office, Bangkok . TYPE LOCALITY: Thailand , Saraburi Prov. , Kaengkhoi Dist, "outside the entrance to the bat cave, half-way up the face of a wooded limestone cliff, 200 meters altitude." DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Korat Plateau in Thailand . COMMENTS: See Musser (1981 b) for discussion of original citation.
Myomys yemeni Sandborn and Hoogstraal, 1953 . Fieldiana, Zoology, 34:241 . TYPE LOCALITY: Yemen , Kariet Wadi Dhahr, six miles northwest of San'a , 6400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from N Yemen and SW Saudia Arabia (see map in Harrision and Bates, 1991:249). COMMENTS: Originally described by Sanborn and Hoogstraal (1953) as a subspecies of M. fumatus , the diagnostic traits of yemeni are outside the range of variation recorded for any sample of fumatus . Our study of holotype and specimens of yemeni and fumatus at the Field Museum of Natural History revealed that yemeni is much larger than fumatus (no overlap in length of molar rows, for example), has paler pelage and significantly larger ears and auditory bullae (both absolutely and relative to body size). The morphological attributes of yemeni define a distinctive species of Myomys ; its phylogenetic relationships to other species in the genus have yet to be resolved. The species (under fumatus ) was reviewed by Harrison and Bates (1991) .
Myomys derooi Van der Straeten and Verheyen, 1978 . Z. Säugetierk., 43:33 . TYPE LOCALITY: Togo , Borgou, 160 m . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Ghana , Togo , Benin , and W Nigeria (see map in Van der Straeten and Verheyen, 19786). COMMENTS: A form found living in and around human dwellings. Part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ).
Myomys daltoni (Thomas, 1892) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 10:181 . TYPE LOCALITY: West Africa (see discussion in Rosevear, 1969:412 ) . DISTRIBUTION: From Gambia and Senegal through Sierra Leone , N Ivory Coast , S Mali , Burkina Faso , Ghana , Togo , Benin , Nigeria , S Chad and Central African Republic to SW Sudan ; eastern limits unresolved. SYNONYMS: butleri, ingoldbyi, saturatus ( Ingoldby, 1929 , not Lyon, 1911 ), tuareg. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Rosevear (1969) and Van der Straeten and Verheyen (19786). Although its range is allopatrically complementary to the distribution of M. fumatus , M. daltoni is probably not conspecific with that E African species. Chromosomal morphology is presented by Matthey (1964) . The name tuareg was described as a subspecies of Grammomys macmillani , but listed by Rosevear (1969) as a species of Grammomys of doubtful validity, and finally identified by Braestrup and Hutterer (1985) as a possibly distinct subspecies of M. daltoni. Setzer (1956) retained butleri, known only by the holotype collected in SW Sudan , as a species, but its morphological traits, judged by Setzer's description, are those of M. daltoni.
Myomys ruppi (Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1983) . Annis. Mus. R. Afr. C., 237:121 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Bonke, north of Bulta, 2800-3200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia ; known only from Bonke and Bulta in the Gamo Gofa region of SW Ethiopia , 2700-3200 m . COMMENTS: Originally described as a species of Praomys (see Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1983 ) based on material collected by Rupp (1980) , who illustrated the skull as " Praomys albipes , stenocephaler Typ" (p. 92). M. ruppi combines morphological features of both M. albipes and Stenocephalemys , an observation reinforced by morphometric analyses ( Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1983 ). Were it not for the long tail of M. ruppi (a trait shared with M. albipes ), the species could as easily be included within Stenocephalemys .
Myomys fumatus (Peters, 1878) . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss., p. 200 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Ukamba . DISTRIBUTION: Africa; from EC Tanzania north through Kenya and N Uganda into Somalia , Ethiopia , and S Sudan ; W and S limits unknown. SYNONYMS: altisoni, brockmani , niveiventris , oweni , subfuscus , ulae . COMMENTS: Kenya samples were discussed by Hollister (1919) , the Uganda series by Delany (1975) , and the Ethiopian segment by Yalden et al. (1976) . Chromosomal and immunological information provided by Qumsiyeh et al. (1990) .
Myomys verreauxii (Smith, 1834) . S. Afr. Quart. J., 2:156 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape of Good Hope, near Cape Town . DISTRIBUTION: South Africa , SW Cape Prov. , from Olifants River in the west to Nature's Valley, Plettenberg Bay in the east (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:271 ). SYNONYMS: colonus , veroxii. COMMENTS: A South African endemic. Taxonomy reviewed by Meester et al. (1986) ; distributional and biological information provided by Skinner and Smithers (1990) .
Neohydromys fuscus Laurie, 1952 . Bull. Br. Mus. (Nat. Hist.) Zool., 1:311 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Chimbu Prov. , N slopes Mt Wilhelm, 9000- 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; scattered localities from Mt Wilhelm east to highlands of Wau region (see map in Flannery, 1990b :l 80). COMMENTS: Phallic morphology similar to that characterizing Mayermys (Lidicker, 1968) . Certain derived cranial and dental features unite Neohydromys , Mayermys , and Pseudohydromys as close relatives (e.g., all share the derived pattern of cephalic arterial circulation; Musser and Heaney, 1992 ).
Nesokia bunnii (Khajuria, 1981) . Bull. Nat. Hist. Res. Centre, 7:162 . TYPE LOCALITY: Iraq , Basra Province , Al-Qurna . DISTRIBUTION: Marshes at the confluence of Tigris and Euphrates rivers in SE Iraq ; probably also occurs in bordering portion of Iran . COMMENTS: Originally described under genus Erythronesokia by Khajuria (1981)) , but shown to be a very distinctive species of Nesokia by Al-Robaae and Felten (1990).
Nesokia indica (Gray and Hardwicke, 1830) . Illustr. Indian Zool., 1:pl. 11 . TYPE LOCALITY: India (uncertain) . DISTRIBUTION: Modern range covers Bangladesh , NE India ( Bihar ), NW India (Kumaon and Rajputana), Pakistan , Afghanistan , Iran , Iraq , Syria , Saudi Arabia , Israel , NE Egypt , NW China ( Xinjiang ), Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Tadzhikistan . Late Pleistocene sites are beyond modern range in Egypt and in N Sudan ( Osborn and Helmy, 1980 ). SYNONYMS: bacheri , bailwardi , beaba , boettgeri , brachyura , buxtoni , chitralensis, dukelskiana , griffithi , hardwickei , huttoni , insularis , legendrei , myosura, satunini, scullyi , suilla . COMMENTS: Chromosomal data in different contexts reported by Thelma and Rao (1982) , Rao et al. (1983) , Juyal et al. (1989) , and Dubey and Raman (1992) . External, cranial, and dental morphology supported a close phylogenetic relationship with Bandicota ( Misonne, 1969 ; Niethammer, 1977 ; Wroughton, 1908), and electrophoretic comparisons of eight loci indicated a sister-species alliance with B. indica ( Radtke and Niethammer, 1984 / 85). Substantial morphological variation is present among geographic samples of N. indica , and careful systematic revision is required to determine whether this variation represents one or more species.

Neohydromys Laurie, 1952 . Bull. Br. Mus. (Nat. Hist.) Zool., 1:311 . TYPE SPECIES: Neohydromys fuscus Laurie, 1952 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ).
Niviventer Marshall, 1976 . Family Muridae: rats and mice. Government Printing Office, Bangkok , p. 402 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus niviventer Hodgeson, 1836 . COMMENTS: Diagnosed and contrasted with other Indo-Sundaic genera by Musser (1981 b) , who also reviewed morphological, chromosomal, and distributional information. Morphological and geographic aspects of seven species ( andersoni , brahma , cremoriventer , eha , excelsior , hinpoon , and langbianis ) are defined; limits of the others ( confucianus , coxingi , culturatus , fulvescens , niviventer , and rapit ) require resolution by taxonomic revision. Closest phylogenetic relatives are Indochinese Chiromyscus and Dacnomys ; among Sundaic genera, Niviventer shares dental derivations with Berylmys , Leopoldamys , and Maxomys ( Musser, 1981 b ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Analyses of chromosomal data postulated chromosomal similarities among Niviventer, Lenothrix, and possibly Maxomys , and an origin from a common ancestor ( Gadi and Sharma, 1983 ). Analyses of biochemical and morphological data for Malayan Peninsula species documented by Chan et al. (1979) , who demonstrated substantial separation from Rattus and alliance with Lenothrix in protein variation,but equivocal affinities in morphological context. Spermatozoal morphology equivocal in assessing phylogenetic relationships ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ). Phallic morphology of three Chinese taxa described by Yang and Fang (1988) in context of assessing phylogenetic relationships among Chinese murines. See Musser (1981 b) for discussion of the original citation.
Mus tenellus (Thomas, 1903) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1903(1):298 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Blue Nile , Roseires . DISTRIBUTION: Sudan , S Ethiopia (below 2000 m ; Rupp, 1980 ), S Somalia , and south through Kenya to C Tanzania ( Dodoma ); limits unknown. SYNONYMS: aequatorius, delamensis, gerbillus , suahelica. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Reviewed by Petter (1972«) and Yalden et al. (1976) . Morphologically and ecologically closely similar to M. haussa (see that account). The southernmost record is based on the holotype of gerbillus ( Allen and Loveridge, 1933 ) , which is an example of M. tenellus . Yalden et al. (1976) listed gallarum as a synonym of M. tenellus , but the holotype is an example of M. musculoides . Judged by our studies of museum specimens, most published Ethiopian records of M. tenellus are actually M. musculoides .
Mus triton (Thomas, 1909) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:548 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Mt Elgon, Kirui, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: N Zaire and E Zaire ( Kivu region ), Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania , Malawi , Tete Dist. of Mozambique , Zambia , and Angola . SYNONYMS: birungensis , fors, imatongensis, murilla, naivashae . COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Listed as a questionable synonym of M. mahomet by Yalden et al. (1976:30) who were unsure about the equivalence of mahomet and triton and merely noted that Ethiopian samples previously identified as triton were really mahomet . The description of Mus birungensis ( Lonnberg and Gyldenstolpe, 1925 ) mirrors the range of variation of M. triton in series (in the American Museum of Natural History) we have examinied from the Kivu region of E Zaire . Considerable chromosomal polymorphism has been reported in samples identified as M. triton ( Robbins and Baker, 1978 ) . Extant southern limit of species is Zambia and Tete Dist. of Mozambique (about 17°S ), but it was present in Natal, South Africa up to about 60,000 years ago ( Avery, 1991 ).
Mus terricolor Blyth, 1851 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 20:172 . TYPE LOCALITY: S India , Bengal, neighborhood of Calcutta . DISTRIBUTION: Indigenous to peninsular India , Nepal , and Pakistan ; occurs also in Medan region of N Sumatra ( Indonesia ) where it was probably inadvertently introduced ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 , discussed under dunni ). SYNONYMS: beavanii, dunni . COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus . Formerly referred to as M. dunni (J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977b, 1986), but terricolor is the older name. Chromosomal results presented by Sharma et al. (1986 , under dunni ) in context of evolutionary divergence from other species of Mus .
Mus vulcani (Robinson and Kloss, 1919) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 4:378 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Java , Gunung Gede, Gandang Badak, 7900 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to moss forests in mountains of W Java . COMMENTS: Subgenus Coelomys . Originally described as a subspecies of Mycteromys crociduroides (see Chasen, 1940 ), but is a separate species. Both M. vulcani and M. crociduroides are the only native Mus known from islands on the Sunda Shelf (Musser, 1986; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Mylomys Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:224 . TYPE SPECIES: Mylomys cuninghamei Thomas, 1906 (= Golunda dyboioskii Pousargues, 1893 ). COMMENTS: The Indian Golunda and Mylomys are usually considered close relatives of each other, but Musser (1987) discussed traits that indicated a distant relationship between the two genera and a closer phylogenetic alliance between Mylomys and Pelomys .
Mylomys dybowskii (Pousargues, 1893) . Bull. Soc. Zool. Fr., 18:163 . TYPE LOCALITY: Central African Republic (= French Congo ), Kemo River . DISTRIBUTION: Guinea (Mt Nimba), Ivory Coast , Ghana , S Cameroon , Congo , Central African Republic , W, N and E Zaire , Rwanda , Tanzania , Kenya , Uganda , and S Sudan . SYNONYMS: alberti, christyi, cuninghamei , lowei , massaicus , rex , richardi, roosevelti . COMMENTS: Hatt (1940a) noted that the cotypes of dybowskii are examples of Mylomys and not Pelomys , under which the name had been listed ( Ellerman, 1941 ), and selected a lectotype . The identity was verified by F. Petter (1962b) . Significance of geographic variation in chromatic and morphological traits has yet to be assessed by critical systematic revision; whether the genus is monotypic or contains more than one species is unresolved. Chromosomal data for sample from Central African Republic reported by Matthey (1970), and those from Mt Nimba ( Guinea ) provided by Gautun et al. (1986) . The taxon rex , represented only by the holotype , a skin without skull from Kaffa in C Ethiopia , was described by Thomas (1906a) as a species of Arvicanthis , but later "provisionally considered as a giant member of Desmomys " ( Thomas, 1916a:68 ). Dieterlen (1974) challenged the validity of rex , but Yalden et al. (1976) pointed out the features distinguishing the holotype from samples of D. harringtoni , and treated rex as another distinctive species endemic to Ethiopia . Our study of the holotype skin reveals it to be a large and probably old adult of Mylomys that is not as brightly pigmented as most samples of that genus. Whether the holotype actually came from Ethiopia , or represents a separate species of Mylomys are unknown; we provisionally list rex in the synonymy of M. dybowskii .
Myomys albipes (Rüppell, 1842) . Mus. Senckenberg., 3:107 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Massawa . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia ; endemic to Ethiopian Plateau between 1500-3300 m ( Yalden et al., 1976 ; Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1983 ). SYNONYMS: rufidorsalis alettensis, rufidorsalis ankoberensis, leucopus , albipes var. minor (see Yalden et al., 1976 ). COMMENTS: Usually listed as either a species of Myomys ( Allen, 1939 ) or Praomys (e.g., Yalden et al., 1976 ). Morphometric traits related albipes closely to species of Stenocephalemys and what was described as Praomys ruppi ( Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1983 ). Furthermore, qualitative external, cranial (see figure 5 in Rupp, 1980 ), and molar (see figures in Misonne, 1969 ) traits of albipes are more similar to species of Stenocephalemys than to most species in Myomys. The phylogenetic significance of this morphologically annectant relationship of M. albipes between other Myomys and Stenocephalemys needs to be assessed by taxonomic revision of both groups. The Sudanese specimens reported by Setzer (1956) as P. albipes fuscirostris are not M. albipes.
Myomys Thomas, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 16:477 . TYPE SPECIES: Epimys colonus (see Allen, 1939 ; = Mus verreauxii A. Smith, 1834 ). SYNONYMS: Myomyscus . COMMENTS: Because some workers claimed colonus was unidentifiable and therefore Myomys is invalid, Myomyscus was proposed by Shortridge (1942) to replace Myomys . The problem and historical opinions were reviewed by Roberts (1951) , Ellerman et al. (1953), Rosevear (1969) , Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1978b) and Meester et al. (1986) . Should Myomys really prove to have no nomenclatural status, Myomyscus is the name to use for this group. In aspects of their morphology, the species seem to be arboreal and scansorial counterparts of those in Mastomys , all of which are primarily terrestrial. Some species of Myomys may be closely related to the Mastomys complex. Chromosomal and immunological data related Myomys fumatus to species of Mastomys ( Qumsiyeh et al., 1990 ) , and morphometric analyses placed M. verreauxii closer to Mastomys than to other species of Myomys ( Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1983 ) . Some workers (e.g., Misonne, 1969 , 1974 ; Qumsiyeh et al., 1990 ) included Myomys and Myomyscus within Praomys . We retain Myomys separate from Mastomys and Praomys until the species within each of these groups are defined, and the systematic relationships among the groups are assessed by careful revision.
Praomys rostratus (Miller, 1900) . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:637 . TYPE LOCALITY: Liberia , Mt Coffee . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from forest in Liberia , Mt Nimba region of Guinea , and Ivory Coast ; limits unresolved. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of tullbergi , but Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1981) distinguished rostratus from tullbergi by its greater body size, noted that both kinds were sympatric, and raised rostratus to specific rank. A similar distribution of body sizes, as well as different ecologies, were recorded by Gautun et al. (1986) from Mt Nimba , and they also separated their samples into either P. tullbergi or P. rostratus . P. rostratus is part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ).
Praomys minor Hatt, 1934 . Am. Mus. Novit., 708:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: C Zaire , Lukolela . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of P. jacksoni ( Hatt, 1934b ) , and then treated as a subspecies of P. tullbergi ( Petter, 1975c ) , minor is a distinct species in the P. jacksoni complex ( Van der Straeten and Dudu, 1990 ) .
Praomys misonnei Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1987 . Stuttg. Beitr. Naturk. ser. A, 402:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Zaire , Kivu region , Irangi . DISTRIBUTION: N and E Zaire . COMMENTS: Sympatric with P. jacksoni at the type locality and with P. jacksoni and P. mutoni in Haut-Zaïre ( Van der Straeten and Dudu, 1990 ). Regarded as related to P. tullbergi by Van der Straeten and Dieterlen (1987) . The type series and examples of misonnei we examined from the Ituri Forest in E Zaire and Gamangui in Haut-Zaïre, where P. jacksoni was also trapped, are morphologically very similar to P. tullbergi ; the possibility that misonnei simply represents populations of P. tullbergi at the eastern margins of its geographic range needs to be considered in any systematic revision of the complex. Qumsiyeh et al. (1990) identified Kenyan samples as P. misonnei , and their chromosomal and electrophoretic characteristics relate the samples to Mastomys hildebrandti ; identity of the Kenyan material should be reassessed.
Praomys mutoni Van der Straeten and Dudu (1990) . In Peters and Hutterer (eds.), Vertebrates in the tropics, Museum Alexander Koenig, Bonn, p. 75 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Zaire (Haut-Zaïre), Batiabongena (Masako Forest Reserve), 00°36'N , 25’13'E . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from the type locality. COMMENTS: A distinct forest species related to P. jacksoni and occurring sympatrically with it ( Van der Straeten and Dudu, 1990 ).
Praomys morio (Trouessart, 1881) . Bull. Soc. Etudes Sci. Angers, 10:121 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Mt. Cameroon , 7000 ft ; see Rosevear (1969:399) . DISTRIBUTION: Mt. Cameroon . SYNONYMS: maurus (of Gray, 1862, not Waterhouse, 1839 ). COMMENTS: A member of the P. tullbergi complex. We restrict P. morio to Mt. Cameroon , although Eisentraut (1970) recorded it from Bioko, and Petter (1965) discussed samples from the Central African Republic . The species requires definition; alledged distinctions between it and P. tullbergi may not reflect specific differences (Hutterer, in litt.). Our study revealed that series from outside of Mt. Cameroon identified as morio are either tullbergi or an undescribed species of Praomys (the series from Central African Republic , for example).
Pseudomys albocinereus (Gould, 1845) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1845:78 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , "scrubby plains near Perth" (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:171 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , SW Western Australia (from Shark Bay area southeast to Israelite Bay); also found on islands of Bernier, Dorre, Shark Bay, and Woody (see map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:196 ). SYNONYMS: squalorum. COMMENTS: Analysis of phallic morphology suggested P. albocinereus belongs in group with P. fumeus and P. shortridgei ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ) , but electrophoretic data placed it in a cluster containing P. apodemoides and seven other species, excluding P. fumeus and P. shortridgei ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) . Dental traits suggested P. albocinereus is closely related to the Pliocene P. vandycki , and if resemblance reflects monophyly, the two species form a distinct group within Pseudomys (Godthelp, 1989) . But Watts (in litt.) wrote that "virtually all data supports close relationships between P. apodemoides and P. albocinereus . Relationships beyond this are any ones guess." See also Watts et al. (1992) .
Praomys tullbergi (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 13:205 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ghana , Ashanti , Wasa, Ankober River . DISTRIBUTION: Forest and Guinea woodland from Gambia River in the west through Cameroon to N and E Zaire ; Bioko; also NW Angola (specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History); limits unknown. SYNONYMS: burtoni (of Thomas, 1892, not Ramsay, 1887). COMMENTS: Reviewed by Rosevear (1969) , Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1981) , and more recent reports cited in the above species accounts. Closely related to P. misonnei , P. morio , and P. rostratus .
Pseudohydromys murinus Rummler, 1934 . Z. Säugetierk., 9:48 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Morobe Prov. , Mt Missim, 7000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; known only from the type locality and high slopes of Mt Wilhelm ( Laurie, 1952 ).
Pseudohydromys occidentalis Tate, 1951 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 97:224 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, north of Lake Wilhelmina, Lake Habbema, 3225 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; known only from the area around Lake Habbema and slopes of Mt Wilhelmina in Irian Jaya ( Tate, 1951:225 ) and the Star Mtns and Victor Emmanuel Range in W Papua New Guinea (Flannery, 19906:181).
Pseudohydromys Riimmler, 1934 . Z. Säugetierk., 9:47 TYPE SPECIES: Pseudohydromys murinus Riimmler, 1934 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Closely related to Mayermys and Neohydromys in phallic morphology (Lidicker, 1968) as well as external, cranial, and dental traits.
Pseudomys Gray, 1832 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1832:39 . TYPE SPECIES: Pseudomys australis Gray, 1832 . SYNONYMS: Gyomys , Mastacomys , Paraleporillus , Thetomys . COMMENTS: Taxonomic, distributional, and biological references to all species cataloged by Mahoney and Richardson (1988) . Member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ), part of which is the Conilurini where Lee et al. (1981) and Baverstock (1984) placed Pseudomys . Data from several character suites have been used to estimate relationships among species of Pseudomys : anatomy of male and female reproductive tracts ( Breed, 1980 , 1985 , 1986); phallic morphology ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ; Morrissey and Breed, 1982 ); spermatozoal morphology (Breed, 1983, 1984; Breed and Sarafis, 1978 ); electrophoretic ( Baverstock et al., 1977 a, 1981 ); and chromosomal ( Baverstock et al., 1977c , 19836). Despite such different approaches, no study estimating phylogenetic relationships is available that integrates all these data with information from skins, skulls, and dentitions. So of all the distinctive groups of species comprising what is now called Pseudomys , opinion still ranges from including them all in one genus ( Pseudomys ) to allocating them to three genera ( Pseudomys, Gyomys , and Leggadina ) to merging Mastacomys and Leporillus with Pseudomys (see discussions in Baverstock et al., 1981 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981 ; Breed, 1983; Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ; and Watts et al., 1992 ). Watts et al. (1992) discussed the futility of attempting to split Pseudomys and they regarded it as a single but complex genus in which results from microcomplement fixation confirmed its monophyly relative to the other Australian murines except Mastacomys , which they merge with Pseudomys . Vie follow that taxonomic decision here.
Pogonomys loriae Thomas, 1897 . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 18:613 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., mountains behind Astrolabe Range, near Mt Wori, Haveri, 700 m (see Laurie and Hill, 1954:96 , for details) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; throughout highland habitats from Vogelkop in the west to the Owen Stanley Range in the east; also a small sample from Fly River drainage in SC Papua New Guinea (in the American Museum of Natural History); and on Goodenough and Fergusson Isis in the the d'Entrecasteaux Arch. Australia , NE coastal Queensland (see discussion and map in Watts and Aslin, 1981:64 ). SYNONYMS: dryas , fergussoniensis . COMMENTS: The morphological and geographic definition of this species is unsatisfactory. Significance of the appreciable geographic variation in external, cranial, and dental dimensions among samples need to be assessed by a careful revision; more than one species may be represented. Mahoney and Richardson (1988: 170) catalogued taxonomic, distributional, and biological references for the Australian sample (which was identiifed as P. mollipilosus by Watts and Aslin, 1981 ); we provisionally include it under P. loriae .
Pogonomelomys mayeri (Rothschild and Dollman, 1932) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1932(353):14 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Weyland Range, Gebroeders Mtns, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; mountains from Weyland Range in Irian Jaya to Wau region in Morobe Prov. of Papua New Guinea ; not known from farther east in Owen Stanley Range. COMMENTS: Phallic morphology described by Lidicker (1968).
Pogonomelomys bruijni (Peters and Doria, 1876) . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 8:336 . TYPE LOCALITY: W New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Pulau Salawati, off W coast of Vogelkop . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; known only by 11 specimens from type locality, Vogelkop mainland, lower Fly River, and low altitudes on Mt Bosavi and Mt Sisa in Papua New Guinea ( Menzies, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: brassi. COMMENTS: The lowland morphological and phylogenetic counterpart of the highland P. mayeri .
Pogonomys championi Flannery, 1988 . Rec. Aust . Mus., 40:333 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , West Sepik Prov. , Telefomin Valley, Ofektaman, 1400 m (see Flannery, 1988, for additional information) . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; known only from Telefomin and Tifalmin valleys between 1400 and 2300 m (Flannery, 1988). COMMENTS: Morphologically similar to P. sylvestris .
Pogonomelomys sevia (Tate and Archbold, 1935) . Am. Mus. Novit., 803:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Morobe Prov. , Huon Peninsula, Cromwell Range, Sevia, 1400 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Central Cordillera of Papua New Guinea from Star Mtns in the west to the Wau region of Morobe Prov. in the east, including mountains of Huon Peninsula ( Flannery, 1990b ; Menzies, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: tatei . COMMENTS: Originally described as a species of Melomys by Tate and Archbold (1935) and subsequently transferred to Pogonomelomys by Rümmler (1938) where it remained ( Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Tate, 1951 ) until Menzies (1990) made sevia the type species of Abeomelomys . The species has always been considered distinctive compared to mayeri and bruijnii ( Flannery, 1990b ; Tate, 1951 ), but the traits used by Menzies to diagnose Abeomelomys do not distinguish that genus from Pogonomelomys.
Pogonomys Milne-Edwards, 1877 . C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 85:1081 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus (Pogonomys) macrourus Milne-Edwards, 1877 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea and Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). A chromosomal and morphometric study, representing an incomplete review of genus, was offered by Dennis and Menzies (1979) . Additional chromosomal data were reported by Donnellan (1987) .
Praomys jacksoni (de Winton, 1897) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 20:318 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Entebbe . DISTRIBUTION: From C Nigeria through Cameroon and Central African Republic to S Sudan , Zaire , N Angola , Uganda , Rwanda , Kenya , and southward through E Tanzania to N and E Zambia . SYNONYMS: montis , peromyscus, sudanensis, viator . COMMENTS: At one time listed as a subspecies of P. tullbergi (e.g., Hollister, 1919 ), jacksoni is a distinct species ( Allen, 1939 ; Ansell, 1978 ; Van der Straeten and Dieterlen, 1987 ; Van der Straeten and Dudu, 1990 ) occurring sympatrically with P. tullbergi . The problem of identifying the holotype of jacksoni as well as current names associated with the species was reviewed and discussed by Van der Straeten and Dieterlen (1987) and Van der Straeten and Dudu (1990) . The latter authors recognized montis and peromyscus as species; the P. jacksoni complex is probably composite, but until the forms representing potential species ( viator , montis , peromyscus) have been diagnosed and their geographic ranges described we include them here under P. jacksoni . Van der Straeten and Dieterlen (1992) reported results from craniometrical camparisons among four samples of P. jacksoni collected at differnent altitudes ( 850-3300 m ).
Pogonomys macrourus (Milne-Edwards, 1877) . C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris, 85: 1081 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Vogelkop, Arfak Mtns, Amberbaki . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; throughout lowland and midmontane forests from sea level to 1500 m (see map in Flannery, 19906:203); also recorded from Yapen (Japen Isl) and New Britain Isl in the Bismarck Arch ( Rümmler, 1938 ). SYNONYMS: derimapa, huon, lepidus , mollipilosus (see Tate, 1951 ; Dennis and Menzies, 1979 ). COMMENTS: Phallic morphology described by Lidicker (1968).
Pogonomys sylvestris Thomas, 1920 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 6:534 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Morobe Prov. , Rawlinson Mtns, 1500 m . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; mountains above 1300 m . COMMENTS: True sylvestris has been recorded only from Papua New Guinea . Previous records from Irian Jaya represent other species or morphologically distinctive montane isolates related to sylvestris at either the specific or subspecific level.
Praomys delectorum (Thomas, 1910) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:430 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Malawi , Mlanji Plateau, 5500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: High plateaus and isolated mountains from NE Zambia (Nyika Plateau, Makutus, and Mafingas; see map in Ansell, 1978 ) and Malawi (see map in Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ), through Tanzania to SE Kenya . SYNONYMS: melanotus , octomastis, taitae . COMMENTS: Of the synonyms belonging here, taitae was described as a species ( Heller, 1912 ) and recognized as such by Hollister (1919) and Swynnerton and Hayman (1951) , melanotus was described as a form of P. tullbergi ( Allen and Loveridge, 1933 ) , and octomastis was presented as a subspecies of P. jacksoni ( Hatt, 1940b ) . Demeter and Hutterer (1986) suggested that taitae was synonymous with Hylomyscus denniae , but it is not, judging from our study of specimens and holotypes .
Praomys hartwigi Eisentraut, 1968 . Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 19:8 -11. TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Lake Oku . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality and Gotel Mtns in Nigeria (Hutterer et al., 1992; Nikolaus and Dowsett, 1989 ). SYNONYMS: obscurus . COMMENTS: Still recorded only by a few specimens ( Misonne, 1974 ; Nikolaus and Dowsett, 1989 ).
Praomys Thomas, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 15:4 TYPE SPECIES: Epimys tullbergi Thomas, 1894 . COMMENTS: Myomys (or Myomyscus ), Mastomys , and Hylomyscus have been united with Praomys as subgenera (D. H. S. Davis, 1965; Misonne, 1974 ), but are treated as separate genera here and by other workers such as Rosevear (1969) , who also reviewed the taxonomic history of some species in Praomys as well as its generic status relative to the other genera allied with it. Van der Straeten and Dieterlen (1987) and Van der Straeten and Dudu (1990) provided brief reviews of the historical and current allocations of forms to the P. tullbergi , P. jacksoni , and P. delectorum complexes. Chromosomal and biochemical traits reviewed or referenced by Qumsiyeh et al. (1990) , who combined Myomys and Mastomys with Praomys . Additional chromosomal information recorded by Maddalena et al. (1989) . Not only do the contents of Praomys require careful systematic revision, but its phylogenetic relationships relative to Mastomys , Myomys , and Hylomyscus also needs resolution through revisionary studies.
Pelomys fallax (Peters, 1852) . Bericht Verhandl. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , 17:275 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mozambique , Caya Dist., Zambesi River and Boror, Licuare River . DISTRIBUTION: S Kenya , SW Uganda , Tanzania , Zaire , Angola , Zambia , Malawi , Mozambique , E and NW Zimbabwe , and N Botswana . SYNONYMS: australis , concolor , frater , insignatus, iridescens, luluae, rhodesiae, vumbae (see Allen, 1939 ; Meester et al., 1986 ). COMMENTS: Appreciable variation in size and fur color exists between samples from Angola and Zambia and those from the rest of the geographic range of P. fallax , suggesting more than one species may be present in this complex. No extant records are from South Africa but the species occurred in Natal more than 17,000 years before present when the region was covered with deciduous woodland instead of thornveld ( Avery, 1991 ).
Pelomys campanae (Huet, 1888) . Le Naturaliste, ser. 2, 10 (31):143 . TYPE LOCALITY: W Angola , Landana . DISTRIBUTION: WC and N Angola and W Zaire . COMMENTS: A distinctive species that occurs either sympatrically or parapatrically with P. fallax in parts of its range ( Crawford-Cabral, 1983 ).
Paulamys naso (Musser, 1981) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 169:112 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Isis), Pulau Flores, Menggarai Prov., Liang Toge, cave near Warukia, 1 km south of Lepa . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Flores Isl. COMMENTS: Originally described and known only from subfossil fragments ( Musser, 1981c ; Musser et al., 1986 ), but one extant specimen has been referred to this species by Kitchener et al. (1991a) , who suggested it is closely related to Sulawesian Bunomys . This assessment needs testing by study of more extant specimens of P. naso in a phylogenetic context that would also compare the sample to species of native New Guinea and Australian Rattus .
Paruromys ursinus (Sody, 1941) . Treubia, 18:312 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , SE peninsula, Gunung Lampobatang, Wawokaraeng, 2200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the upper slopes of Gunung Lampobatang, Sulawesi. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of Taeromys dominator by Sody (1941:312) , and usually listed as a subspecies of Paruromys dominator ( Musser, 1984 ) , but treated as distinct species by Musser and Holden (1991) .
Pelomys hopkinsi Hayman, 1955 . Rev. Zool. Bot. Afr., 52:323 . TYPE LOCALITY: SW Uganda , Kigezi, Rwamachuchu . DISTRIBUTION: Rwanda , Uganda , and SW Kenya (see Bekele and Schütter, 1989). COMMENTS: Morphologically similar to P. isseli , but significant distinguishing traits suggested that hopkinsi and isseli should be viewed as separate species (Bekele and Schütter, 1989).
Pelomys Peters, 1852 . Bericht Verhandl. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , 17:275 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus (Pelomys) fallax Peters, 1852 . SYNONYMS: Komemys . COMMENTS: Definition and phylogenetic position of Pelomys needs to be reassessed in context of a systematic revision of arvicanthine murines. In overall morphology, the genus is most closely related to Mylomys and Desmomys . Komemys is usually treated as a subgenus for the species hopkinsi and isseli (e.g., Delany, 1975 ), but we recognize it here as a synonym of Pelomys .
Paulamys Musser, 1986 . In Musser et al., Am. Mus. Novit., 2850:2 . TYPE SPECIES: Floresomys naso Musser, 1981 . SYNONYMS: Floresomys (Musser, 1981, not Fries et al., 1955 ; see reference in Musser et al., 1986 ).
Pelomys isseli (de Beaux, 1924) . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 51:207 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Lake Victoria, Kome Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Uganda ; endemic to islands of Kome, Bugala, and Bunyama in Lake Victoria (Bekele and Schütter (1989; Delany, 1975 ). COMMENTS: Closely related to P. hopkinsi .
Pelomys minor Cabrera and Ruxton, 1926 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 17:601 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Luluabourg . DISTRIBUTION: N Angola , NW Zambia , S and E Zaire , and W Tanzania . COMMENTS: A very distinct species, but aspects of its morphology resemble some species of Lemniscomys (e.g., L. griselda ).
Phloeomys cumingi (Waterhouse, 1839) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1839:108 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Luzon Isl . DISTRIBUTION: S Luzon, Marinduque , and Catanduanes Isls ( Heaney et al., 1991 ; Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). SYNONYMS: albayensis, nomen nudum (see Ellerman, 1941:293 ), elegans . COMMENTS: Sometimes considered conspecific with P. pallidus , but cumingi is a distinct species ( Thomas, 1898b ).
Pithecheir melanurus F. G. Cuvier, 1833 . In E. Geoffroy and F. G. Cuvier, Hist. Nat. Mammifères, pt. 4, 7(66):1 -2 "Pithéchéir Mélanure". TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Java . DISTRIBUTION: Java only (see Musser, 1982d:76 ). COMMENTS: Represented by few specimens.
Phloeomys pallidus Nehring, 1890 . Sitzb. Ges. Naturf. Fr. Berlin , p. 106 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Luzon Isl . DISTRIBUTION: N Luzon; limits unknown.
Pithecheir parvus Kloss, 1916 . J. Fed. Malay St. Mus., 6:250 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malay Peninsula, Selangor , Bukit Kutu , near Kuala Kubu, 3,400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Malay Peninsula ( Pahang and Selangor ). COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of P. melanurus , but is a distinctive species endemic to Malay Peninsula ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ; Muul and Lim, 1971 ). Karyotype has same diploid number as Hapalomys longicaudus , but is uninformative about inferring phylogenetic relationships (Yong, et al., 1982). Spermatozoal morphology very distinctive (no apical hook), unlike that of any other Sundaic endemic ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ), and resembles sperm of Sulawesian Lenomys and Eropeplus ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ) .
Phloeomys Waterhouse, 1839 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1839:108 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus (Phloeomys) cumingi Waterhouse, 1839 . COMMENTS: Part of the Philippine Old Endemics, but actual phylogenetic relationships relative to other members of that group and to genera in other areas of IndoAustralian region unclear ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). Listed as a member of Phloeomyinae by Simpson (1945) , along with Chiropodomys , Coryphomys , Crateromys , Lenomys , Mallomys , and Pongonomys, but no data supports such an allocation.
Pithecheir F. G. Cuvier, 1833 . In E. Geoffroy and F. G. Cuvier, Hist. Nat. Mammifères, pt. 4, 7(66):1 -2 "Pithéchéir Mélanure". TYPE SPECIES: Pithecheir melanurus Cuvier, 1838 . COMMENTS: An endemc of the Sunda Shelf that Musser and Newcomb (1983) suggested, on the basis of cranial and dental traits, was distantly related to Lenothrix , an estimate of phylogenetic affinités unsupported by chromosomal data ( Yong et al., 1982 ) and spermatozoal morphology ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ).
Pogonomelomys Rümmler, 1936 . Z. Säugetierk., 11:248 . TYPE SPECIES: Melomys mayeri Rothschild and Dollman, 1932 . SYNONYMS: Abeomelomys . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Revised by Menzies (1990) . Originally described as a subgenus of Melomys , but now regarded as a distinct genus ( Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Menzies, 1990 ; Tate, 1951 ); its phylogenetic relationships to Melomys and other related genera still requires elucidation.
Oenomys ornatus Thomas, 1911 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:378 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ghana , Bibianaha, near Dunkwa . DISTRIBUTION: SE Guinea (Mt Nimba) to Ghana . COMMENTS: Originally described by Thomas (19116) as a distinct species, and subsequently either listed that way ( Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ) or included in hypoxanthus ( Misonne, 1974 ) . Rosevear (1969) , however, recognized ornatus as a very distinctive subspecies of O. hypoxanthus , and Tranier and Gautun (1979) reinstated its specific uniqueness diagnosed by chromosomal, morphological, and distributional attributes.
Papagomys armandvillei (Jentink, 1892) . Weber's Zool. Ergebn., 3:79 , pl. 5. TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Isis), Pulau Flores . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Flores Isl. SYNONYMS: besar, verhoeveni . COMMENTS: Known by extant specimens as well as subfossil fragments (3000-4000 years old), and still living on Flores .
Oenomys hypoxanthus (Pucheran, 1855) . Revue Mag. Zool. Paris, ser. 2, 7:206 . TYPE LOCALITY: Gabon . DISTRIBUTION: Tropical forest block from S Nigeria south to N Angola , and east across Zaire (incl. islands of Zaire river between Kisangani and Kinshasa; Colyn and Dudu, 1986 ) to Rwanda , Burundi , and Uganda ; isolated forest patches in S Sudan , SW Ethiopia , Kenya and W Tanzania (see section of map east of Ghana in Dieterlen and Rupp, 1976 ). SYNONYMS: albiventris, anchietae , bacchante, editus, marungensis, moerens, oris; rufinus ( Matschie, 1895 , not Temminck, 1855), talangae, unyori, vallicola. COMMENTS: Another African species showing appreciable geographic variation in fur color and body size ( Dieterlen and Rupp, 1976 ; Thomas, 1915 ). Chromosomal data reported by Matthey (1963 , 1967) and Maddalena et al. (1989) . Closest phylogenetic relative is probably Thamnomys ( Hatt, 1940a ) .
Palawanomys furvus Musser and Newcomb, 1983 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 174:335 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Palawan Isl, Brooke's Point Municipality, Mt Mantalingajan, 4500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Known only by four melanistic examples.
Papagomys Sody, 1941 . Treubia, 18:322 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus armandvillei Jentink, 1892 . COMMENTS: Formerly thought closely related to Mallomys , but has no affinity to that New Guinea Old Endemic, and instead is phylogenetically related to Komodomys and Pleistocene Hooijeromys , both endemics of Nusa Tenggara ( Musser, 1981c ). Species of Papagomys reviewed by Musser (1981 c) .
Palawanomys Musser and Newcomb, 1983 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 174:335 . TYPE SPECIES: Palawanomys furvus Musser and Newcomb, 1983 . COMMENTS: Phylogenetic affinities unclear, but among murines native to the Sunda Shelf, Palawanomys appears most closely allied to the cluster of genera that would include Rattus ; broader regional comparisons required before affinities can be determined ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Oenomys Thomas, 1904 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7,13:416 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus hypoxanthus Pucheran, 1855 . SYNONYMS: Aenomys .
Paruromys dominator (Thomas, 1921) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 7:244 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , N Sulawesi , Minahassa, Mt Masarang, 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; throughout the island except upper slopes of Gunung Lampobatang in SW peninsula ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: frosti (see Musser, 19715). COMMENTS: Taxonomic allocations of dominator from the time it was originally described as a species of Rattus by Thomas (1921a) , through its use as type-species of subgenus Paruromys by Ellerman {in Laurie and Hill, 1954 ), up to its inclusion in subgenus Bullimus by Misonne (1969) were reviewed by Musser and Newcomb (1983) . Sody (1941) listed dominator as a species of Taeromys. Spermatozoal morphology of dominator is unlike species of Rattus or any other species for which data from spermatozoal morphology are available ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ).
Papagomys theodorverhoeveni Musser, 1981 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 169:95 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara (Lesser Sunda Isis), Pulau Flores, Menggarai Prov., Liang Toge, a cave near Warukia, 1 km south of Lepa . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Flores Isl. COMMENTS: Known only by subfossil fragments (3000-4000 years old), but possibly still living on Flores .
Parahydromys asper (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:326 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua, New Guinea , Central Prov., Owen Stanley Range, Richardson Range, Mt Gayata, 2000-4000 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Central Cordillera from Weyland Range in Irian Jaya to Owen Stanley Range in Papua New Guinea , as well as Huon Peninsula (see map in Flannery, 19905:185). COMMENTS: Thought to be closely related to Hydromys (Flannery, 1989; Lidicker, 1968; Tate, 1951 ), but no critical assessment of that hypothesis has been made. Flannery (19905) provided distributional and biological notes. Donnellan (1987) provided chromosomal data.
Paraleptomys wilhelmina Tate and Archbold, 1941 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1101:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, near Mt Wilhelmina, 9 km NE Lake Habbema, 2800 m . DISTRIBUTION: C New Guinea ; known only from N slopes of Snow Mtns between Idenburg River and Mt Wilhelmina in Irian Jaya ( Tate and Archbold, 1941 ) and the Tifalmin Valley in W Papua New Guinea ( Flannery and Seri, 1990:189 ).
Paraleptomys rufilatus Osgood, 1945 . Fieldiana Zool., 31:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Cyclops Mtns, Mt Dafonsero, 4700 ft . DISTRIBUTION: NC New Guinea ; known only from N Coast Ranges in Irian Jaya (Cyclops Mtns) and adjacent Papua New Guinea (Torricelli Mtns); see map in Flannery (19905:179). COMMENTS: A very distinct species (Flannery, 19905; Osgood, 1945 ) that along with Microhydromys musseri and Petaurus abidi is endemic to the N Coastal Ranges (Flannery, 19905).
Parahydromys Poche, 1906 . Zool. Anz., 30:326 . TYPE SPECIES: Limnomys asper Thomas, 1906 . SYNONYMS: Drosomys , Limnomys (Thomas, 1906, not Mearns, 1905). COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Phallic morphology of incomplete specimen described by Lidicker (1968).
Paruromys Ellerman, 1954 . In Laurie and Hill, List of land mammals of New Guinea , Celebes and adjacent islands, p. 117 . [1954] TYPE SPECIES: Rattus dominator Thomas, 1921 . COMMENTS: Described by Ellerman as a subgenus of Rattus , but now recognized as distinct genus ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Paraleptomys Tate and Archbold, 1941 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1101:1 . TYPE SPECIES: Paraleptomys Wilhelmina Tate and Archbold, 1941 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Based on cranial and phallic traits (Lidicker, 1968; Tate, 1951 ), Paraleptomys is traditionally considered closely related to Leptomys , but this hypothesis requires testing.
Mesembriomys gouldii (Gray, 1843) . List Specimens Mamm. Coll. Br. Mus., p. 116 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , Port Essington . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; N Western Australia , N Northern Territory , N Queensland , Melville Isl, and Bathurst Isl ( Watts and Aslin, 1981 ; Friend, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: hirsutus (Gould, 1842, not Elliot, 1839), melvillensis, rattoides . COMMENTS: Analyses of chromosomal and electrophoretic data (Baverstock et al., 1977«, c, 1981, 1983b) as well as phallic and dental morphology ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ; Misonne, 1969 ) indicated M. gouldii is phylogenetically most closely related to species of Conilurus .
Melomys rubex Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:263 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Mamberano River, Doormanpad-bivak, 1410 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; above 800 m in the Central Cordillera from the Arfak Mtns in Irian Jaya to Mt Dayman at the end of the Owen Stanley Range in SE Papua New Guinea ; also in the Torricelli Mtns and Huon Peninsula. SYNONYMS: alleni , arfakiensis , clarus, pohlei, rutilus , shawi , steini , stressmani, tafa. COMMENTS: The many names applied to M. rubex reflect morphological variation among some samples that is concordant with interrupted highland distributions. Taxonomic status of some names associated with rubex briefly reviewed by Menzies (1974) . The form shawi is usually listed as a subspecies of M. moncktoni ( Laurie and Hill, 1954:123 ) , but the holotype is an example of M. rubex .
Melomys rufescens (Alston, 1877) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1877:124 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Duke of York Isl. or adjacent parts of New Britain or New Ireland " ( Tate, 1951:304 ) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; throughout the island continent, from the Vogelkop in Irian Jaya to the east end of Papua New Guinea , coastal lowlands to high altitudes in mountains. Also on New Britain , Duke of York Isl, and New Ireland (see Flannery and White, 1991 ) in the Bismarck Arch. SYNONYMS: calidior, hageni, musavora, niviventer , sexplicatus, stalkeri . COMMENTS: The significant geographic variation in morphological traits present among samples allows recognition of four distinct groups; rufescens from N and W New Guinea and the Bismarck Arch., niviventer from Fly River drainage, stalkeri from E Papua New Guinea , and hageni from the Eastern Highlands (based on our study of specimens in the American Museum of Natural History and the British Museum of Natural History).
Melomys rubicola Thomas, 1924 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 13:298 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Torres Strait, Bramble Cay, about 9°S , 144°E . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; endemic to Bramble Cay at the extreme northern end of the Great Barrier Reef of Queensland ( Limpus et al., 1983 ). COMMENTS: Studies of blood proteins and morphology suggested M. rubicola was closely related to M. capensis , which is endemic to Cape York in N Queensland ( Limpus et al., 1983 ). Structure of sperm head described by Breed (1984) .
Melomys spechti Flannery and Wickler, 1990 . Aust . Mammal., 13:130 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Buka Isl, Kilu rockshelter . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Buka Isl. COMMENTS: A distinctive species known only by archaeological fragments ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ).
Mesembriomys Palmer, 1906 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 19:97 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus hirsutus Gould, 1842 (= Hapalotis gouldii Gray, 1843 ). SYNONYMS: Antinomys. COMMENTS: Member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c: 167 ), which includes the Conilurini where Baverstock (1984) placed Mesembriomys , and closely related to Leporillus and Conilurus ( Watts et al., 1992 ). Mahoney and Richardson (1988:164) cataloged taxonomic, distributional, and biological references.
Micromys minutus (Pallas, 1771) . Reise Prov. Russ. Reichs., 1:454 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Ulyanovsk . Obi. Middle Volga River, Simbirsk (now Ulyanovsk ) . DISTRIBUTION: From NW Spain through most of Europe, across Siberia to Ussuri region and Korea, north to about 65° in European Russia and Yakutia, south to N edge of Caucasus and N Mongolia ; isolated ranges in S China west through Yunnan to SE Tibet and NE India ( Assam ). Island distributions include Britain, Japan (Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Tsushima), Quelpart Isl ( Korea ), and Taiwan ; see Corbet (1978c) for details.

COMMENTS: Reviewed by Corbet (1978c , 1984 ). Chromosomal information reported by Jüdes (1981) , Zima (1983) , Lungeanu et al. (1984) , Solleder et al. (1984) , and Schmid et al. (1987) . European populations reviewed by Böhme (1978«). Phallic morphology of Chinese samples described by Yang and Fang (1988) in context of assessing relationships among Chinese murines.
Mesembriomys macrurus (Peters, 1876) . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , p. 355 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , "at a small mainland creek, Mermaid Strait" ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:164 ) .

SYNONYMS: boweri .
Microhydromys richardsoni Tate and Archbold, 1941 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1101:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Idenburg River, 4 km SW Bernhard Camp, 850 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; scattered localities in hill forest from type locality east to Sogeri in Port Moresby region (see map in Flannery, 19906:184). COMMENTS: Known only by four specimens (Flannery, 1989). Distributional and biological data summarized by Flannery (1990b:184) . Microhydromys richardsoni possesses the primitive pattern of the cephalic arterial circulation, a conformation shared with species of Crossomys , Hydromys , and Parahydromys , but not with Leptomys or the other genera of shrew mice ( Mayermys , Neohydromys , and Pseudohydromys ).
Microhydromys musseri Flannery, 1989 . Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W, 111:216 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , West Sepik Prov. , Torricelli Mtns, Mt Somoro, 1350 m (see Flannery, 1989, for details) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Represented only by the holotype . A very distinct Microhydromys that is part of a highland fauna endemic to the N Coast ranges of Papua New Guinea (Flannery, 1989).
Micromys Dehne, 1841 . Micromys agilis, Ein Neues Säugetier der Fauna von Dresden, p. 1 . TYPE SPECIES: Micromys agilis Dehne, 1841 (= Mus minitus Pallas, 1771 ). COMMENTS: Only one extant species is recognized by most workers, but at least five others are documented by Miocene ( Storch, 1987 ) and Pliocene ( Weerd, 1979 ) fossils. Whether the extant samples represent one or more species has yet to be resolved by critical systematic revision.
Microhydromys Tate and Archbold, 1941 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1101:2 . TYPE SPECIES: Microhydromys richardsoni Tate and Archbold, 1941 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Reviewed by Flannery (1989).
Melomys mollis Thomas, 1913 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 12:210 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Nassau Range, upper Utakwa River, S slope Mount Carstenz, Camp Padang, 6c, 5500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; scattered in montane forest throughout Central Cordillera from Arfak Mtns in Vogelkop of Irian Jaya to Mt Dayman in extreme E Papua New Guinea . SYNONYMS: arfakianus, clarae, meeki , stevensi. COMMENTS: Specimens representing M. mollis have been identified as M. levipes in the literature, and the synonyms listed here have also been associated with that species. However, judged by our study of specimens in the American Museum of Natural History and the British Museum of Natural History, Melomys mollis is a distinct species tied to montane forest formations and differs from M. levipes in habitat and morphology. Specimens from W Irian Jaya are more darkly pigmented than those from E Papua , but series from Papuan Central and Eastern highlands bridge this chromatic gap.
Melomys levipes (Thomas, 1897) . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 18:617 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Papua, Central Prov., Sogeri Plateau, Haveri, 700 m (additional information provided by Laurie and Hill, 1954:121 , and Menzies, 1989 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea , S Central Prov.; Sogeri Plateau and Atrolabe Range near Port Moresby , below about 700 m ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: A lectotype was designated by Menzies (1989) , but Rümmler (1938) had already indicated which of Thomas' two cotypes should be considered the holotype . Our examination of series indicated that true levipes is documented by the holotype and Tate's (1951:291) series from Baruari and Itiki in the Astrolabe Range (other material Tate lists as M. levipes is either M. platyops or M. mollis ). All the other records usually associated with M. levipes ( Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Tate, 1951 ) represent M. lanosus , M. lorentzii , M. mollis , and M. rattoides . In morphology and altitudinal distribution, M. levipes is very similar to M. lorentzii and may represent the SE Papuan form of that species, an alliance also discerned by Thomas (1913b) . A specimen from New Britain in the American Museum of Natural History (194397) is cranially and dentally similar to M. levipes .
Melomys lorentzii (Jentink, 1908) . Nova Guinea , 9:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Lorentz River, Resi Camp, 900 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; specimens are from Vogelkop (Oransbari), Weyland Range (midaltitudes), and along the south side of Central Cordillera, from Rapare River in SW Irian Jaya to middle altitudes and lowlands of the Fly River drainage in Papua New Guinea ; limits unknown. Altitudinal range from sea level to about 1500 m . SYNONYMS: naso , sturti , weylandi. COMMENTS: The form naso is usually listed as a subspecies of M. levipes ( Flannery, 1990b ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ), but Rümmler (1938) correctly identified the holotype as an M. lorentzii . Tate's (1951:296) sturti was described as a subspecies of M. moncktoni , but the holotype and type series are examples of M. lorentzii . The form iveylandi, from the Weyland Range in SE Irian Jaya , is usually listed as a subspecies of M. levipes , but specimens in the type series are examples of M. lorentzii . Usually listed as a subspecies of M. levipes ( Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Tate, 1951 ), lorentzii is a distinct species that resembles M. levipes in many morphological traits; however, M. moncktoni may be closer to M. lorentzii judged by Menzies's (1990) morphometric similarity coefficient analysis. Significance of the appreciable variation in body size among samples needs to be assessed in a revision of M. lorentzii , and a phylogenetic inquiry into its closest relatives.
Melomys leucogaster (Jentink, 1908) . Nova Guinea , 9:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , S Irian Jaya, Lorentz River, Alkmaar, 300 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; S side of Central Cordillera from the type locality in Irian Jaya east to E Papua New Guinea on the mainland (see map in Flannery, 1990b:234 ); also Yule Isl off the coast of E Papua New Guinea in Central Prov., Conflict Isis, and Rossel Isl in Louisiade Arch., Moluccas , Seram and Talaud Isis. SYNONYMS: arcium , caurinus , fulgens , talipes, talaudium . COMMENTS: A close morphological relative of M. rufescens . Melomys leucogaster is one of the few New Guinea species that also occurs on archipelagos to the SE and W of that island continent. The population on Rossel Isl was listed as M. arcium by Laurie and Hill (1954) , and that on Seram and the Talauds as M. fulgens .
Melomys rattoides Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:263 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , NW Irian Jaya, Mamberano River, Pionier-bivak ( 2°20'S , 138°0’ E ), 200 ft . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; N slopes and lowlands from the type locality in Irian Jaya through slopes N of Idenberg River to the Telefomin region in West Sepik Prov. of Papua New Guinea ( Flannery and Seri, 1990 ); also on Pulau Yapen (Japen Isl); limits of range unknown. No records from above 1200 m . COMMENTS: The distribution is based on the few reliable identifications of samples. Tate's (1951:290) records of M. rattoides from Cyclops Mts, for example, were based on M. lanosus , as were the easternmost dots on Flannery's (1990b:229) map. Closest relative is M. lanosus , which occurs in moss forests at altitudes higher than the distribution of M. rattoides (see account of M. lanosus ).
Melomys moncktoni (Thomas, 1904) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 14:399 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Northern Prov., NE coast, 8°30'S , 148°20'E (Kumusi River) . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; reliable records are from coastal plains and foothills (not exceeding 700 m ) of extreme SE Papua New Guinea , from the type locality on the NE coast eastward to southern lowlands where westernmost record is from foothills northeast of Port Morseby area; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Horizontal and altitudinal distributions of this species have been misunderstood due to incorrect identifications of specimens. Melomys moncktoni was thought to have a primarily southern distribution from Irian Jaya to Papua , and to extend up into moss forest (see map and discussion in Flannery, 1990b:225 ), but all samples from moss forest represent other species. Examples of M. moncktoni come only from the restricted range described above (based on series in the American Museum of Natural History and the British Museum of Natural History). The forms intermedius , shawi , and sturti are usually associated with M. moncktoni ( Flannery, 1990b ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Tate, 1951 ), but the holotype of shawi is a M. rubex , the type series of intermedius belongs to M. platyops , and the type series of sturti represents M. lorentzii .
Melomys platyops (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:327 . TYPE LOCALITY: SE Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., head of Aroa River . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea , lowlands and midmountain altitudes both north and south of the Central Cordillera, and on islands; in the north from Nabire (coastal lowlands) in NW Irian Jaya to the east end of Papua New Guinea , then west through S New Guinea to the Utakwa River in SW Irian Jaya. Also occurs on islands of Yapen (Japen) and Biak in Irian Jaya; New Britain in the Bismarck Arch.; and the isls of Normanby, Fergusson, and Goodenough in the d'Entrecasteaux Arch. Altitudinal range from sea level to 900 m . SYNONYMS: fuscus , intermedius , jobiensis , mamberanus. COMMENTS: This species was thought to range primarily throughout N New Guinea (see map in Flannery, 1990b: 224 ) but our reidentification of museum specimens and holotypes reveals otherwise. The form intermedius was originally described as a subspecies of M. moncktoni (see Riimmler, 1938), but type series from Utakwa River (type locality) in SW Irian Jaya have only one hair per scale (all M. moncktoni have three hairs per scale), as does M. platyops , and their cranial, dental, and other external traits are also characteristic of platyops , not moncktoni . Most of the 25 topotypes Tate (1951:297) identified as M. moncktoni sturti from the lower Fly River are also examples of M. platyops . Geographic variation in body size exists among samples of M. platyops , and a careful systematic revision of the species is required to assess its significance.
Melomys obiensis (Thomas, 1911) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:208 TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Malukus, Pulau Obi . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Obi Isl, S of Halmahera. COMMENTS: Judged by morphological traits, a close relative of M. fraterculus from Seram, and more closely related to Australian Melomys cervinipes than to any New Guinea species, an observation gleaned from our study of specimens and earlier recorded by Tate (1951:297) .
Melomys capensis Tate, 1951 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 97:295 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Nesbit River, Rocky Scrub (E of Coen), 1500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Australia , Queensland , Iron and Mcllwraith Ranges of Cape York (north of Cooktown). COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of M. cervinipes by Tate (1951:295) , but separated as a distinct species by Baverstock et al. (1980) , who based their conclusions on differences in blood proteins; otherwise, the two species are similar in morphological traits and body size ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:82 ). Other electrophoretic results presented by Baverstock et al. (1981) .
Melomys aerosus (Thomas, 1920) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 6:428 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Pulau Seram, Mt Manusela, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Seram Isl. COMMENTS: Tate (1951:292) suggested a relationship between M. aerosus and the New Guinea M. levipes group, but cranial morphology indicates M. aerosus to be more closely related to Australian species of Melomys , especially M. cervinipes , than to the endemic Melomys of New Guinea (data from specimens in the British Museum of Natural History).
Melomys burtoni (Ramsay, 1887) . Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S.W., ser. 2, 2:531 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Western Australia , near Derby . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; along the coast "from just south of the New South Wales-Queensland border, north to the tip of Cape York, and in coastal areas of the Northern Territory and north-eastern Western Australia " ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:84 ); also found on many offshore islands, including those in Torres Strait. New Guinea ; patchy distribution (grassland habitats) on both sides of Central Cordillera, near sea level to 2200m (see map in Flannery, 19906:231); also on Woodlark Isl in d'Entrecasteax Arch., and Misima Isl in Louisiade Arch. SYNONYMS: albiventer , australius , callopes , frigicola , froggatti, hintoni, insulae, littoralis , lutillus , melicus , mixtus , murinus , muscalis. COMMENTS: Results of chromosomal and electrophoretic studies reported by Baverstock et al. (1977 c, 1980 , 1981, 19836). Anatomy of male reproductive tract and spermatozoal morphology presented by Breed and Sarafis (1978) , Morrissey and Breed (1982) , and Breed (1984 , 1986). We follow Tate (1951) and Mahoney and Richardson (1988) in treating populations from Australian and New Guinea region as a single species, but the complex needs revision using data from morphological, chromosomal, and molecular sets to assess significance of the variation apparent both among samples from New Guinea and between those from New Guinea and Australia .
Melomys bougainville Troughton, 1936 . Rec. Aust . Mus., 19:344 . TYPE LOCALITY: Solomon Isis, Bougainville Isl, Bouin . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to islands of Buka and Bougainville in Solomon Arch. ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ). COMMENTS: Although historically treated as a subspecies of M. rufescens , M. bougainville is a separate species known by small samples of extant and archaeological specimens ( Flannery and Wickler, 1990 ).
Melomys Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:261 . TYPE SPECIES: Uromys rufescens Alston, 1877 . SYNONYMS: Paramelomys . COMMENTS: Member of the Australian and New Guinea region Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c , 19826). Morphological and distributional limits need revision. Currently, three primary groups can be recognized: (1) species endemic or indigenous to New Guinea region ( fellowsi , gracilis , leucogaster , levipes , lorentzii , mollis , moncktoni , platyops , and rufescens ); (2) Australian species ( capensis , cervinipes , rubicola ), one occurring on Australia and New Guinea ( burtoni ), and some Moluccan species ( aerosus , fraterculus , and obiensis ); (3) New Guinea lanosus and rattoides . Data from microcomplement fixation of albumin indicated Australian Melomys was closely related to Uromys and in the same monophyletic group with Mesembriomys , Leporillus , Conilurus , and Zyzomys ( Watts et al., 1992 ) . Mahoney and Richardson (1988) cataloged taxonomic, distributional, and biological references to Australian species; Flannery (19906) summarized the same for many of the New Guinea Melomys.
Melomys fellowsi Hinton, 1943 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 11, 10:554 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Purari-Ramu Divide, Baiyanka, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; known only from a few places at high elevations in the central highlands; see map in Flannery (1990b:222) . COMMENTS: A distinctive species that resembles M. rufescens and M. leucogaster in some morphometric features ( Menzies, 1990 ).
Melomys gracilis (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:328 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Papua New Guinea , Northern Prov., Angabunga (St Joseph's) River, Owgarra, 1800 m . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; specimens from high altitudes (above 1200 m ) along Central Cordillera from Owen Stanley Range (type locality, head of Aroa River, Mt Tafa, Mafulu,) through the Eastern Highlands (Garaina area, Wau region, Kratke Mts, Upper Ramu River Plateau, Okapa area) to the slopes of Mt Hagen (Tomba). SYNONYMS: dollmani . COMMENTS: Although usually listed as a subspecies or synonym of M. rufescens ( Flannery, 1990b ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Tate, 1951 ), M. gracilis is a separate species. It is sympatric with M. rufescens in the Kratke Mts, on the Upper Ramu River Plateau , in the Okapa area, and at Tomba (specimens in the American Museum of Natural History and the British Museum of Natural History).
Melomys fraterculus (Thomas, 1920) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 6:428 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Pulau Seram, Mt Manusela, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Seram Isl. COMMENTS: Placed in Pogonomelomys by Riimmler (1938), kept there by Tate (1951) , but returned to Melomys by Laurie and Hill (1954) . Based on our study of specimens, Melomys fraterculus shares many derived cranial features with the Australian M. cervinipes complex and is probably more closely related to the indigenous Australian Melomys than to those on New Guinea .
Melomys cervinipes (Gould, 1852) . Mamm. Aust ., pt. 4, 3:pl. 14 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Stradbrook Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; extant range is closed forest and more open habitat along the E Australian coast from Cooktown region of Cape York in Queensland south to Gosford area of New South Wales ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:79 ). Late Pleistocene specimens indicated distribution once extended farther south to the Pyramids Cave region in Victoria ( Wakefield, 1972a ). SYNONYMS: banfieldi , bunya, eboreus, limicauda , pallidus . COMMENTS: Anatomy of male reproductive tract and spermatozoa reported by Breed and Sarafis (1978) , Morrissey and Breed (1982) , and Breed (1984 , 1986). Chromosomal morphology, G-banding homologies, and results of electrophoretic analyses presented by Baverstock et al. (1977 c, 1980 , 1981, 1983b), who (1980) reported that M. cervinipes was phylogenetically close to M. capensis , but electrophoretically distant, having experienced a rapid rate of electrophoretic evolution relative to that found in M. capensis and M. burtoni .
Melomys lanosus Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. ser. 9, 9:263 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Doormanpad-bivak ( 3°30'S , 138°30'E ), 2400 m . DISTRIBUTION: Mountain forests (not recorded below 1500 m ) of N New Guinea ; from the type locality in Irian Jaya eastward along Central Cordillera through the Telefomin region, Schrader Range, Kratke Mts, and Mt Hagen region to the Wau area of Papua New Guinea ; also from Cyclops Range in the N coastal mts; not known from Huon Peninsula. SYNONYMS: shawmayeri . COMMENTS: Once treated as a subspecies of M. levipes , lanosus , as Flannery (1990b:230) noted, is a separate species. It is unrelated to M. levipes , but instead is phylogenetically allied with M. rattoides , a larger-bodied species that displaces it in lower altitudes. This close association was also reflected in Menzies' (1990) similarity coefficient analysis. Our study of specimens in the American Museum of Natural History revealed that Melomys lanosus and M. rattoides share derived traits (only one pair of teats, and the derived cephalic arterial circulation and its osseous reflection in the cranium; see figures in Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) not found in any other species of Melomys . Any systematic revision of Melomys will have to determine whether these two species are members of that genus, which seems unlikely. Flannery listed shawmayeri as a synonym of M. rattoides , but holotype is example of M. lanosus .
Maxomys surifer (Miller, 1900) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 13:148 . TYPE LOCALITY: Peninsular Thailand , Trang . DISTRIBUTION: Indochina (S Burma , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia , and Vietnam ) and the Sunda Shelf (Peninsular Thailand , Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and many smaller islands). SYNONYMS: anambae , antucus, aoris, banacus, bandahara, bentincanus , binominatus, butangensis, casensis , carimatae , catellifer , changensis, connectens , domelicus , eclipsis, flavidulus, flavigrandis, finis, grandis , koratis, krantis, kutensis, leonis , luteolus , mabalus, manicalis, microdon , muntia, natunae, pelagius, pemangilis, perflavus , pidonis, pinacus, puket, ravus , saturatus , serutus , siarma, solaris, spurcus, telibon, tenebrosus, ubecus , umbridorsum , verbeeki. COMMENTS: The only species of Maxomys with a range encompassing Indochinese and Sundaic faunal regions. The two groups of samples differ in morphological features, and the significance of this variation should be determined in a careful systematic revision of the genus. Berylmys bowersii , Chiropodomys gliroides , Leopoldamys sabanus , and L. edwardsi have roughly concordant geographic ranges and demonstrate similar geographic variation (Musser et al., 1979; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Comparative spermatozoal morphology documented by Breed and Yong (1986) , chromosomal and biochemical data summarized by Chan et al. (1979) in phylogenetic context.
Maxomys musschenbroekii (Jentink, 1878) . Notes Leyden Mus., 1:10 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , NE peninsula, Menado . DISTRIBUTION: Throughout Sulawesi (Musser, 1991; Musser and Holden, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: aspinatus , lalawora, tetricus. COMMENTS: Considered conspecific with Sundaic M. whiteheadi by Ellerman and MorrisonScott (1951), but musschenbroekii is a distinct species endemic to Sulawesi ( Medway , 1977 ; Musser, 1991). Spermatozoal morphology more similar to that described for Malayan species of Maxomys than to sperm of other sampled Sulawesian species ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ).
Maxomys pagensis (Miller, 1903) . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 45:39 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Kepulauan Mentawai, Pulau Pagai Selattan (S Pagai Isl), off coast W Sumatra . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to islands of South Pagai, North Pagai, Sipora, and Siberut in Mentawai Archipelago. COMMENTS: Usually listed as a subspecies of M. surifer ( Chasen, 1940 ) , but treated as a species by Musser et al. (1979). Closest phylogenetic relative is probably M. surifer . Part of the rodent fauna endemic to Mentawi Archipelago (see account of Leopoldamys siporanus ).
Maxomys rajah (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:451 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sarawak (N Borneo), Gunung Batu Song . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to the Sunda Shelf; Peninsular Thailand south of Isthmus of Kra, Malay Peninsula, Riau Archipelago, Sumatra, amd Borneo; absent from Java and Bali. SYNONYMS: hidongis, lingensis , pellax , similis . COMMENTS: Distribution similar in broad outline to that of M. whiteheadi . Occurs sympatrically with M. surifer , and although samples of each are often misidentified, the two differ in a suite of morphological, ecological, behavioral, and biochemical features ( Chan et al., 1979 ; see references in Musser et al., 1979).
Maxomys moi (Robinson and Kloss, 1922) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:95 . TYPE LOCALITY: Vietnam , Lang Bian Mtns, Arbre Broyé, 5400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to S Vietnam and S Laos . COMMENTS: Originally described as a species by Robinson and Kloss (1922) , later listed as a subspecies of either surifer or coxingi , but finally shown to be a distinct species (Musser et al., 1979; Van Peenen et al., 1969 ). Closest phylogenetic relative is M. surifer , an estimate based on cranial, dental, and chromosomal traits shared by both species ( Duncan and Van Peenen, 1971 ; Musser et al., 1979).
Maxomys panglima (Robinson,1921) . Ann.Mag.Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 7:235 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Palawan Isl . DISTRIBUTION: EndemictoBalabac, Palawan ,Busuanga, and Culion Isis; politically part of Philippines ,butfaunisticallyan extension ofthe Sunda Shelf. SYNONYMS: palawanensis . COMMENTS: Treatedinthepastasa subspeciesofM. surifer , but morphological features supporteditsindependenceasa species;uncertain whetherit is more closely related toM. suriferorM. rajah (Musseretal.,1979) .
Maxomys ochraceiventer (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:451 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah (N Borneo), Gunung Kinabalu, below 3000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Sabah and Sarawak (N Borneo), and East Kalimantan (E Borneo); apparently restricted to hills ( Medway, 1964 ). SYNONYMS: perasper . COMMENTS: Once treated as a lower altitudinal subspecies of the higher montane alticola ( Chasen, 1940 ) , but the two species are sympatric at 3500 ft on slopes of Gunung Kinabalu ( Medway, 1977 ).
Maxomys wattsi Musser, 1991 . Am. Mus. Novit., 3001:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Gunung Tambusisi, Tambusisi Damar, 4700 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from 4700-6000 ft on Gunung Tambusisi, C Sulawesi. COMMENTS: A morphologically distinctive species; assessing its phylogenetic relations to other species will require systematic revision of Maxomys (Musser, 1991) .
Maxomys whiteheadi (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:452 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah (N Borneo), Gunung Kinabalu . DISTRIBUTION: Peninsular Thailand south of Isthmus of Kra, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, and various adjacent islands; absent from Java and Bali. SYNONYMS: asper , batamanus , batus , coritzae, klossi , mandus , melanurus , melinogaster , perlutus, piratae, subitus. COMMENTS: A Sundaic endemic. Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) included whiteheadi in the Sulawesi musschenbroekii , but the two are separate species ( Chasen, 1940 ; Medway , 1977 ; Musser, 1991; Musser et al., 1979; Tate, 1936). Spermatozoal morphology ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ), and data from biochemical, morphological, and cytological studies ( Chan et al., 1978 , 1979 ; Yong, 1969 ) pointed to a close relationship between M. whiteheadi and the Malayan M. inas .
Melasmothrix naso Miller and Hollister, 1921 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 34:93 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Rano Rano, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; known only from upper montane rain forest at Rano Rano and on Gunung Nokilalaki, but probably occurs on other mountains in central core of island.
Mayermys ellermani Laurie and Hill, 1954 . List of Land Mammals of New Guinea , Celebes and Adjacent Islands, 1952, p. 134 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Chimbu Prov. , Bismarck Range, N slopes of Mt Wilhelm, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; known only from scattered localities along Central Cordillera from Telefomin region in west to Wau area in the east (see map in Flannery 19906:183). COMMENTS: Flannery (19906: 183) provided a photograph of the animal and a summary of distributional and biological data.
Melasmothrix Miller and Hollister, 1921 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 34:93 . TYPE SPECIES: Melasmothrix naso Miller and Hollister, 1921 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1982c) . Closely related to Tateomys as judged by morphological, ecological, and spermatozoal characters ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Musser, 1982c ). Placed in the group of Sulawesian Old Endemics by Musser (1981c) .
Mayermys Laurie and Hill, 1954 . List of Land Mammals of New Guinea , Celebes and Adjacent Islands, p. 133 . TYPE SPECIES: Mayermys ellermani Laurie and Hill, 1954 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c:167 ). Phallic morphology similar to Neohydromys (Lidicker, 1968) . Mayermys , Leptomys , Neohydromys , and Pseudohydromys share a derived configuration of cephalic arterial pattern ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ).
Mus setulosus Peters, 1876 . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , p. 480 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Victoria . DISTRIBUTION: From Guinea (Mt Nimba) and Sierra Leone eastward through Liberia , Ivory Coast , Ghana , Togo , Benin , Nigeria , Cameroon , Gabon , Central African Republic , N Zaire (Haut-Zaïre), S Sudan , WC and S Ethiopia to N Uganda and W Kenya (documented by Rosevear, 1969 ; Petter and Genest, 1970 ; and our study of samples in the American Museum of Natural History, British Museum, Field Museum of Natural History, and National Museum of Natural History). SYNONYMS: pasha , proconodon . COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . A distinct species sometimes confused with M. musculoides , which occurs over approximately the same region ( Rosevear, 1969 ). Both pasha ( Thomas, 1910a ) and proconodon ( Rhoads, 1896 ) were originally described as species. Osgood (1936) associated pasha with M. proconodon , and we agree with his identification. Petter and Matthey (1975) regarded pasha as a species, noting that it might be referable to M. setulosus . Both Osgood (1936) and Yalden et al. (1976) recognized proconodon as a distinct species endemic to Ethiopia . Our study of Osgood's specimens, some of which are near-topotypes, revealed that their morphological traits fell within the range of variation typical of M. selulosus . Our identification was forshadowed by Petter and Matthey (1975) who cited the range of M. selulosus to include Ethiopia , based on a letter from J. Prevost. Chromosomal data for samples from W Africa were documented by Jotterand (1972) , Jotterand-Bellomo (1981 , 1986 ), and Matthey (1964) .
Mus oubanguii Petter and Genest, 1970 . Mammalia, 34:454 . TYPE LOCALITY: Central African Republic , La Maboke, Ippy, Bangassou (Petter, 19816, provided coordinates) . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Central African Republic (savanna north of Oubangui River); see map in Jotterand (1972:332) . COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Sympatric with M. setulosus and M. musculoides ( Petter and Genest, 1970 ) , but a phylogenetic member of the M. sorella group, according to Petter (19816), who also noted that its morphology, except for a dental trait, is similar to that of M. neavei (see that account). Chromosomal information, in context of understanding chromosomal evolution among species of African Mus , was documented by Jotterand (1972) and Jotterand-Bellomo (1984 , 1986 ).

DISTRIBUTION: South Africa ; Orange Free State (see map in Vermeiren and Verheyen, 1983 ). COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Treated as a species possibly allied to M. setzeri by Vermeiren and Verheyen (1983) , but listed as a subspecies of M. minutoides by Meester et al. (1986) , an arrangement followed by Skinner and Smithers (1990) .
Mus pahari Thomas, 1916 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 24:414 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Sikkim , Batasia, 6000 ft .

Mus spretus Lataste, 1883 . Acta Linn. Soc. Bordeaux, ser. 7, 4:27 . TYPE LOCALITY: Algeria , Oued Magra, between M'sila and Barika, north of Hodna . DISTRIBUTION: S France , Spain (incl. Balearic Isis), Portugal , Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and Libya (see map in Marshall, 1981). SYNONYMS: hispanicus , lusitanicus , lynesi, mogrebinus, parvus , rifensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus . This species was the subject of biometrical and morphological analyses ( Darviche and Orsini, 1982 ; Engels, 1980 , 1983b ; Gerasimov et al., 1990 ; Palomo, 1988 ; Palomo et al., 1983 ; Vargas , et al., 1984), as well as chromosomal and electrophoretic studies ( Cano et al., 1984 ; Engels, 1983«; Matsuda and Chapman, 1992 ; Traut et al., 1992 ). Analysis of variability in mitochrondrial DNA revealed two genetically distinct phylogenetic groups within spretus (Boursot, et al., 1985). Differences between M. spretus and M. musculus in thermoregulatory capabilities reported by Górecki et al. (1990) . Alcover et al. (1985) described parvus as a subspecies of M. spretus .
Mus shortridgei (Thomas, 1914) . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 23:30 . TYPE LOCALITY: Burma , Mt Popa, 4961 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Burma , Thailand , Cambodia (see map in J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a:431), and NW Vietnam ( Dao, 1978 ). SYNONYMS: nghialoensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Pyromys . Dao (1966) described nghialoensis as a subspecies of M. platythrix , which at the time embraced the Indochinese shortridgei .
Mus sorella (Thomas, 1909) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:548 . TYPE LOCALITY: W Kenya , Mt Elgon, Kirui, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Documented by specimens from E Cameroon , EC Angola , NE and SE Zaire , Uganda , Kenya , and N Tanzania ( Petter, 1981 b ; Verheyen, 1965a ; specimens in the American Museum of Natural History, and the National Museum of Natural Hitory); limits unknown SYNONYMS: acholi, wamae. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Closest relatives are M. baoulei , M. goundae , M. kasaicus , M. neavei , and M. oubanguii ; Petter (1981 b) placed these (except baoulei ) together in the M. sorella group. Petter (1981 b) also recognized wamae and acholi as species in the sorella complex, but after examining holotypes and other specimens we agree with Verheyen (1965a) , who united them with M. sorella . There are at least two distinct species in the group, M. sorella and M. neavei (see later account), but the nature of their phylogenetic relationship to other forms in this complex needs to be assessed by critical systematic review. Reidentification of museum specimens might also help resolve geographic ranges. The specimens from Angola , for example, were originally identified by Hill and Carter (1941) as M. bella .
Mus spicilegus Petenyi, 1882 . Termeszetrajzi Fuzetek, Budapest , 5:114 . TYPE LOCALITY: Hungary , Budapest , Rakos Plains . DISTRIBUTION: Hungary , Rumania , Yugoslavia , Bulgaria , and steppes of Crimea and S Ukraine . SYNONYMS: mehelyi, sergii. COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus . This is the mouse that constructs soil-covered storage mounds of grain, and was formally known as M. hortulanus (see Corbet, 1984 ); however, the holotype of hortulanus is actually a M. musculus , so the earliest name for the species is spicilegus ( Gerasimov et al., 1990 ) . Results of morphometric and biochemical analyses were reported by Bonhomme et al. (1984) , Petrov and Ruzic (1985) , Gerasimov et al. (1990) , She et al. (1990) , and Lyalyukhina et al. (1991) . Other cytogenetic and biochemical contrasts between the species (reported as hortulanus ) and M. musculus were recorded by Bulatova and Kotenkova (1990) , and Yakimenko et al. (1990) .

(see Ellerman, 1941 ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; and Marshall, in press). COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus . Schwarz and Schwarz (1943) provided a revision that was followed with minor changes by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) . This arrangement was criticized by Jones and Johnson (1965:394) who found that specimens from Asia they studied "bear little or no relation to this idealized classification." Subsequent treatments of this group were presented by J. T. Marshall, Jr. (1977b, 1981, 1986) and Marshall and Sage (1981) . The most recent classification combined biochemical analyses of European, Asian, and African mice ( Bonhomme et al., 1984 ), and the translation of these results, as well as the incorporation of morphological data, into a new view of Mus musculus and its allies (Marshall, in press), that in allocation of the many names to A4, musculus is suprisingly concordant with the treatment of Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) . The scientific names listed under M. musculus by those authors, but now placed elsewhere, are here associated with A4, spicilegus , M. spretus , and A4, macedonicus (see those accounts). Samples of A4, musculus have been the focus of numerous morphometric, chromosomal, and biochemical studies undertaken in context of phylogenetic inquiries; some of the latest contributions that also summarized and cited earlier reports are Evans (1981) , Foster et al.

Analyses, using palaeontological and archaeozoological approaches, of the colonization process of W Eurasia by house mice and their origin of commensalism were presented by Auffray et al. (1988 , 1990a , c) and Auffray and Britton-Davidian (1992) . Analyses of mitochondrial DNA variation among samples from Japanese islands reveal a polyphyletlc origin of Japanese A4, musculus derived from musculus , castaneus , and domesticus strains ( Bonhomme et al., 1989 ).
Mus mayori (Thomas, 1915) . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 23:415 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sri Lanka , Central Mountains, Pattipola, 6200 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to forested regions of Sri Lanka . SYNONYMS: pococki . COMMENTS: Subgenus Coelomys . Phillips (1980) recognized highland ( mayori ) and lowland ( pococki ) as subspecies, and summarized distributional and biological information for both; also see J. T. Marshall, Jr. (1977b) for discussion of chromatic variation within each form.
Mus minutoides Smith, 1834 . S. Afr. Quart. J., ser. 2, 2:157 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , S Cape Prov. , Cape Town . DISTRIBUTION: South Africa (W, S, and E Cape Province , Natal, Zululand, Lesotho , Orange Free State , C and E Transvaal), Swaziland ; northern limits unknown (see Skinner and Smithers, 1990:264 ; Meester et al., 1986:283 ). SYNONYMS: minimus ( Peters, 1852 , not White, 1789), umbratus. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Relationship of this species to M. musculoides has to be assessed by careful systematic revision of the minutoides-musculoides complex (see following account).
Mus musculoides Temminck, 1853 . Esquisses Zool. sur la Côte de Guine , p. 161 . TYPE LOCALITY: West Africa, "Côte de Guine ." DISTRIBUTION: Subsaharan Africa (including Ethiopia and Somalia ) southward to contact with M. minutoides . SYNONYMS: bella , enclavae, gallarum, gondokorae, grata , marica , paulina, pelila, soricoides , sungarae, sybilia, vicina. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Whether the samples reflect only one or a complex of species is unresolved. For example, grata (or gratus ) is often listed as a separate species (Hatt, 1940«; Hollister, 1919 ); Petter and Matthey, 1975 ). Unresolved also is the geographic distribution of M. musculoides , and the nature of the biological relationship between it and M. minutoides . The considerable chromosoal variation among samples from West Africa was documented by Jotterand (1972) and JotterandBellomo (1984, 1986) under the identification of minutoides / musculoides , a label that reflects current understanding of specific limits in this complex. Neither Yalden et al. (1976) nor Rupp (1980) recorded M. musculoides from Ethiopia , but we have seen many specimens from that country (in the British Museum and the Field Museum of Natural History).
Mus neavei (Thomas, 1910) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 5:90 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Zambia , E Loangwe Dist., Petauke, 2400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: S Zaire , E Zambia , S Zimbabwe , Transvaal of South Africa , W Mozambique , and S Tanzania ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Originally described as a species, neavei was later treated as a subspecies of M. sorella ( Verheyen, 1965a ) , an arrangement accepted by Ansell (1978) , Meester et al. (1986) , and Skinner and Smithers (1990) . Petter (1981 b) , however, pointed out that while a member of the A4, sorella group, neavei should be treated as a separate species; in morphology and body size it appears to be close to A4, oubanguii ( Petter, 1981b ) . Our study (series in the American Museum of Natural History, the British Museum of Natural History, and the National Museum of Natural History) corroborates Petter's view. A4, neavei is a distinct species and easily distinguished from A4, sorella by its richer tawny fur, much smaller size, more delicate cranium, and shorter molar rows (3.0-3.2 mm in 7 examples of neavei , 3.2-3.7 mm in nine sorella ). How M. neavei is related to A4, oubanguii and the small-bodied A4. baoulei is unresolved. Meester et al. (1986:282) summarized published distributional information. Supposed records of A4, neavei from Malawi represent other species ( Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ).
Mus haussa (Thomas and Hinton, 1920) . Novit. Zool., 27:319 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nigeria , Farniso . DISTRIBUTION: Records are from Senegal and S Mauritania through Mali , Ivory Coast , Burkina Faso , Ghana , S Niger, and Benin to N Nigeria ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Body size, pelage color and pattern, and other morphological traits of M. haussa are very similar to those of M. tenellus ( Petter, 1963c , 1972a; Rosevear, 1969 ), and F. Petter (1969) came close to combining them. The relationship between M. haussa and M. tenellus needs to be assessed by systematic revision of the group.
Mus cervicolor Hodgson, 1845 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 15:268 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nepal . DISTRIBUTION: Indigenous range from Nepal east through Sikkim into NE India ( Assam ), Burma , Thailand , Laos , Cambodia , and Vietnam (see map in J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a). Also recorded from Sumatra and Java where it has likely been inadvertently introduced ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). SYNONYMS: annamensis, cunicularis, imphalensis, nitidulus , popaeus, strophiatus. COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus .
Mus caroli Bonhote, 1902 . Novit. Zool., 9:627 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan , Ryukyu (= Liukiu) Isis, Okinawa Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Natural range probably from Ryukyu Isis to Taiwan , S China ( Fujian and Yunnan Provs., Hainan Isl, Hong Kong ), Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , and Thailand (N of Isthmus of Kra; see map in J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a). Also recorded from Malay Peninsula (S Kedah State), Sumatra, Java, Madura, and Flores Isis in Nusa Tenggara, all places where it was likely inadvertently introduced ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). SYNONYMS: boninensis, fornwsanus, kakhyenensis, kukilensis, ouwensi. COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus .
Mus crociduroides (Robinson and Kloss, 1916) . J. Str. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc., 73:271 TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Sumatra , Korinchi Peak, 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Upper montane rain forest in mountain chain along W Sumatra . COMMENTS: Subgenus Coelomys . A distinct montane species endemic to the mountains of W Sumatra (Musser, 1986; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Listed by Chasen (1940) as a species of Mycteromys , which also contained the Javan M. vulcani , the closest relative of M. crociduroides .
Mus cookii Ryley, 1914 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 22:663 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Burma , Shan States, Gokteik, 2133 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Peninsular India , Nepal through NE India ( Assam ) to Burma , S China (SW Yunnan ), N and C Thailand , Laos , and N Vietnam (see map in J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a). SYNONYMS: darjilingensis, nagarum , palnica . COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus .
Mus goundae Petter and Genest, 1970 . Mammalia, 34:455 . TYPE LOCALITY: Central African Republic , vicinity of Gounda River ( Petter, 1981b , provided coordinates) . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from the vicinity of the type locality (see map in Jotterand, 1972 ); limits unknown. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Petter (1981 b) treated goundae as a species related to others in the M. sorella group, but the nature of that relationship remains unresolved (see account of M. sorella ). Chromosomal data were reported by Jotterand (1972) .
Mus fernandoni (Phillips, 1932) . Spolia Zeylan., 16:325 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sri Lanka , Mulhalkelle Dist., Kubalgamuwa, 3000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Sri Lanka . COMMENTS: Subgenus Pyromys . Phillips (1980) summarized distributional and biological information.
Mus famulus Bonhote, 1898 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 12:99 . TYPE LOCALITY: S India , Nilgiri Hills, Coonoor, 5000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from the Nilgiri Hills in S India . COMMENTS: Subgenus Coelomys .
Mus indutus (Thomas, 1910) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 5:89 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , N Cape Prov. , Molopo River, west of Morokwen . DISTRIBUTION: South Africa (N Orange Free State , Transvaal, N Cape Prov. ), W Zimbabwe , Botswana , C and N Namibia , (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:264 ). SYNONYMS: deserti , pretoriae, valschensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Skinner and Smithers (1990) and Meester et al. (1986) discussed the morphological and chromosomal distinctions between M. indutus and M. minutoides . Skinner and Smithers (1990) also summarized biological data, and Meester et al. (1986) provided citations for synonyms. The definition of this species is ambiguous ( Meester et al., 1986 ; Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). Meester et al. (1986) included the Angolan sybilla in M. indutus , but our study of the holotype revealed that sybilla belongs with M. musculoides .
Mus kasaicus (Cabrera, 1924) . Boi. Real. Soc. Espanola Hist. Nat., Madrid , 24:222 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Kasai, St. Joseph de Kananga (Luluabourg) . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from the vicinity of the type locality. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Now treated as a distinct species belonging to the M. sorella group ( Petter, 1981b ), but its relationship to that species needs to be assessed in a careful revision of the M. sorella complex (see account of the latter).
Mus macédoniens Petrov and Ruzic, 1983 . Proc. Fauna SR Serbia , Serbian Acad. Sci. and Arts, Belgrade , 2:177 . TYPE LOCALITY: Yugoslavia , Macedonia , near Valandovo . DISTRIBUTION: Yugoslavia , Bulgaria , Turkey , Iran , Syria , Jordan , and Israel . SYNONYMS: spretoides. COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus . Originally desribed as a subspecies of M. hortulanus ( Petrov and Ruzic, 1985 ) , but Bonhomme (1986) and Marshall (in litt.) treated it as a distinct species occurring sympatrically with M. musculus and M. spicilegus (also see map in Petrov and Ruzic, 1985:234 ). Results of biochemical and morphometric analyses of M. macédoniens (under spretoides) in context of phylogenetic studies provided by Bonhomme et al. (1984) , Auffray et al. (1990b) , Gerasimov et al. (1990) , and She et al. (1990) . Fossil history of Israeli M. macédoniens (referred to as spretoides) relative to colonization and origin of commensalism in M. musculus reported by Auffray et al. (1988) .
Mus mahomet Rhoads, 1896 . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , p. 532 . TYPE LOCALITY: SC Ethiopia , Sheikh Mahomet . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopian highlands ( 1500-3400 m ; Rupp, 1980 ; specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History; see map in Yalden et al., 1976 ), SW Uganda and SW Kenya (specimens in the National Museum of Natural History); limits unknown. SYNONYMS: emesi. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Heller (1911) described emesi as a subspecies of M. musculoides , but Hollister (1919:96) and Hatt (1940a) treated it a a distinct species. Our study of Hatt's series from NE Zaire in the American Museum of Natural History revealed they consisted of M. musculoides and M. sorella . The holotype of emesi and most of Hollister's other examples from Uganda do represent a species distinct from M. musculoides ; in morphology and chromatic traits, we cannot distinguish the series of emesi from the large samples of mahomet collected by Osgood in Ethiopia . M. mahomet is sympatric with M. musculoides in Uganda and Kenya and narrowly sympatric or closely parapatric with M. setulosus in Ethiopia ( Yalden et al., 1976 ; specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History). Yalden et al. (1976:30) suspected kerensis might be the correct name for M. mahomet .
Mus mattheyi Petter, 1969 . Mammalia, 33:118 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ghana , Accra . DISTRIBUTION: Recognized only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . This form has been recorded from Senegal , Ivory Coast , Burkina Faso , and Ghana (F. Petter, 1969; Petter et al., 1971 ; Petter and Matthey, 1975 ), but after studying large series (in the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle and the National Museum of Natural History) of the haussa and musculoides complexes from west Africa, we are unable to assign anything to mattheyi . The morphological traits used to distinguish mattheyi from haussa by F. Petter (1969) and Petter and Matthey (1975) vary in a continuous fashion from typical haussa morphology to that considered diagnostic for mattheyi . The status of mattheyi needs to be reassessed in a taxonomic revision of the group. A chromosomal complement of 2N=36, FN=36 characterizes samples identified as M. mattheyi and is considered primitive for African Mus (F. Petter, 1969; Jotterand-Bellomo, 1986 ).
Muriculus imberbis (Rüppell, 1842) . Mus. Senckenberg., 3:110 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Ethiopia , Simien, 3300 m . DISTRIBUTION: Mountains of Ethiopia on both sides of the Rift Valley between 1900 and 3400 m ( Rupp, 1980 ). SYNONYMS: chilaloensis. COMMENTS: Member of a unique rodent fauna endemic to high mountains of Ethiopia . Osgood (1936) described chilaloensis as a subspecies of M. imberbis .
Millardia gleadowi (Murray, 1886) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1885:809 [1886]. TYPE LOCALITY: Pakistan , Sind , Karachi . DISTRIBUTION: Pakistan , adjacent India and Afghanistan . COMMENTS: Raman and Sharna (1977) reported essentially no similarity between karyotypes of M. meltada and M. gleadowi .
Millardia kathleenae Thomas, 1914 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 23:29 . TYPE LOCALITY: Burma , Pagan . DISTRIBUTION: C Burma . COMMENTS: Sody (1941) proposed the genus Millardomys , which is a nomen nudum , for this species.
Millardia meltada (Gray, 1837) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 1:586 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , S Mahratta, Dharwar . DISTRIBUTION: Sri Lanka ; Indian Peninsula west to Gujarat and Rajasthan, north to Himachal Pradesh, and east to West Bengal; E Pakistan ; and Terai region of Nepal (see Rana, 1985 ). SYNONYMS: comberi , dunni , lanuginosus , listoni , pallidior, singuri. COMMENTS: Cytogenetics of this species is the subject of a growing body of literature ( Nanda and Raman, 1981 ; Raman and Sharma, 1977 ; Sobti and Gill, 1984 ; Yosida, 1978). Mandai and Ghosh (1981) described singuri as a subspecies of M. meltada .
Millardia kondana Mishra and Dhanda, 1975 . J. Mammal., 56:76 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Maharashtra State , Poona Dist, Sinhgarh ( 18°23'N , 73°42'E ) . DISTRIBUTION: India ; known only from the Sinhgarh Plateau in the Maharashtra region . COMMENTS: Morphological comparisons between this distinctive species and M. gleadowi , M. kathleenae , and M. meltada were reported by Mishra and Dhanda (1975) .
Millardia Thomas, 1911 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 20:998 . TYPE SPECIES: Golunda meltada Gray, 1837 . SYNONYMS: Grypomys , Guyia , Millardomys . COMMENTS: Listed as a distinct genus by Ellerman in 1941, but later as a subgenus of Rattus ( Ellerman, 1961 ) . By 1969, Millardia was again treated as a genus and thought to be closely related to the Indian Cremnomys ( Misonne, 1969 ) . Subsequent analyses of morphological features and particularly chromosomal traits has demonstrated the great phylogenetic distance between Rattus and Millardia ( Gadi and Sharma, 1983 ; Mishra and Dhandra, 1975; Raman and Sharma, 1977 ). Cytogenetic analyses resulted in a phylogenetic hypothesis isolating Millardia and Cremnomys from other Asian genera ( Gadi and Sharma, 1983 ). Two species of Millardia , until 1982 thought to be strictly an Asian genus, were recorded from the Pliocene of Ethiopia ( Sabatier, 1982 ). One of the species is apparently a Millardia but the other was reidentified as an Acomys (Denys, 1990) .
Muriculus Thomas, 1903 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1902(2):314 [1903]. TYPE SPECIES: Mus imberbis Rüppell, 1842 . COMMENTS: When Thomas proposed Muriculus he suggested it might be related to Lophuromys , but Osgood (1936) found little affinity between the two genera and instead noted a closer morphological relationship with Mus and Zelotomys . The close tie to Mus is real, and Misonne (1974) suggested that Muriculus might be merged with Mus ; however, the middorsal stripe and morphological specializations of rostrum, mandible, incisors, and increased expanse of incisor enamel associated with pronounced proodonty, are not part of the character suite defining Mus , and set Muriculus apart as a very distinctive genus.
Mus callewaerti (Thomas, 1925) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 15:668 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Zaire , Lualaba, Luluabourg, 610 m . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from N and C Angola , S and W Zaire ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . Thomas described this species as a member of the genus Hylenomys , which is now united with Mus ( Hill and Carter, 1941 ; Misonne, 1965). It is the largest-bodied of any of the African Mus ( Petter and Matthey, 1975 ) , has ivory incisors and very large auditory bullae, and in external features resembles M. triton , which misled Hatt (1940«) into treating callewaerti as a subspecies of triton . Misonne (1965) summarized distributional and other information.
Mus booduga (Gray, 1837) . Mag. Nat. Hist. [Charlesworth's], 1:586 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , S Mahratta . DISTRIBUTION: Sri Lanka , Peninsular India (north to Jammu and Kashmir ), S Nepal , and C Burma . COMMENTS: Subgenus Mus . Results from chromosomal analyses reported by Sen and Sharma (1983) and Sharma et al. (1986) in context of evolutionary divergence relative to other species of Mus .
Mus baoulei (Vermeiren and Verheyen, 1980) . Rev. Zool. Afr., 94:573 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ivory Coast , Lamto . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Ivory Coast and E Guinea . COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . A species occurring sympatrically with M. musculoides and M. setulosus , and whose morphology is closely similar to those in the M. sorella group ( Vermeiren and Verheyen, 1980 ). The diagnostic traits reported for M. baoulei by Vermeiren and Verheyen (1980) are those that set M. sorella apart from other species of Mus (Verheyen, 1965«). Judged by their description, baoulei is distinguished from M. sorella by smaller size, a contrast that also exists between M. sorella and M. neavei (see that account). The relationship of baoulei to other members of the M. sorella group requires fresh assessment.
Mus bufo (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18: 145 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Ruwenzori East, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: E Zaire ( Kivu region ), adjacent Uganda , Rwanda , and Burundi ; a montane Western Rift endemic. SYNONYMS: ablutus , wambutti. COMMENTS: Subgenus Nannomys . In body size and morphology, M. bufo superficially resembles the large-bodied M. triton , but the two are distinguished by dental features and tail length ( Petter and Matthey, 1975 ) as well as karyotypes ( Robbins and Baker, 1978 ), and both occur together in the Kivu region of E Zaire (specimens in the American Museum of Natural History). Chromosomal data for Burundi samples reported by Maddalena et al. (1989) .
Mus Linnaeus, 1758 . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:59 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus musculus Linnaeus, 1758 . SYNONYMS: Budamys , Coelomys , Drymomys , Gatamiya , Hylenomys , Leggada , Leggadilla , Musculus , Mycteromys , Nannomys , Oromys , Pseudoconontys , Pyromys , Tautatus . COMMENTS: Extant species of Mus are contained in four distinct subgenera ( Coelomys , Mus , Nannomys , and Pyromys ), each diagnosed by a suite of discrete morphological traits (J. T. Marshall, Jr., 19775, 1986) and biochemical features (Bonhomme, 1986; She et al., 1990 ). Nannomys , Pyromys , and Coelomys were treated as genera by Bonhomme (1986), a view also adopted by She et al. (1990) . The Asian species were reviewed by J. T. Marshall, Jr. (19775) and the European forms by Marshall (1981, 1986), Marshall and Sage (1981) , Bonhomme et al. (1984) , Gerasimov et al. (1990) , and She et al. (1990) . Most of the African species need careful systematic review (see accounts below of species in subgenus Nannomys ) and Ansell (in Meester et al., 1986:280 ) believed the African segment of the genus to be "over-split." Relevance of metrical, chromosomal, and allozyme variation to systematics of Mus was discussed by Corbet (1990). See Carleton and Musser (1984) for authors and publication dates of synonyms.
Lenothrix canus Miller, 1903 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 26(1317):466 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Tuangku Isl (west of Sumatra ) . DISTRIBUTION: Malay Peninsula, Penang Isl, Tuangku Isl, and Borneo ( Sarawak and Sabah ). SYNONYMS: malaisia. COMMENTS: Historical allocations of canus to either Rattus or Lenothrix , as well as comparisons between L. canus and other Sundaic endemics documented by Musser (1981a-c) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) .
Leopoldamys edwardsi (Thomas, 1882) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1882:587 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , mountains of W Fujian (probably Kuatun) . DISTRIBUTION: India (W Bengal, Sikkim , N Assam ), N Burma , S and C China (to S Anhui ; Liu et al., 1985 ), N Thailand , Laos , Vietnam , Malay Peninsula, and W Sumatra. SYNONYMS: ciliatus , garonum, gigas , hainanensis , listeri , melli , milleti , setiger . COMMENTS: Requires taxonomic revision. Samples from Indochina may represent a different species than the one sampled from Malay Peninsula and Sumatra (Musser, 19816). In additon to synonyms assembled by Musser (19816), Xu and Yu (1985) recently described hainanensis . Phallic morphology described by Yang and Fang (1988) in context of assessing phylogenetic relationships among Chinese murines.
Leopoldamys sabanus (Thomas, 1887) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 20:269 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah (N Borneo), Gunung Kinabalu . DISTRIBUTION: Bangladesh , Thailand , Vietnam , Cambodia , Laos , Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and smaller islands on the Sunda Shelf. SYNONYMS: balae , bunguranensis, clarae, dictatorius, fremens , heptneri, herberti, insularum, lancavensis, lucas , luta , macrourus , mansalaris, masae , matthaeus , mayapahit, nasutus , revertens, salanga, stentor , strepitans , stridens , stridulus , tapanulius, tersus, tuancus, ululons, vociférons. COMMENTS: Appreciable morphological variation exists between samples from north and south of Isthmus of Kra, and among insular samples from the Sunda Shelf; systematic revision is required to assess whether variation is characteristic of one or more than one species (Musser, 19816). The name macrourus has priority over sabanus , but is based on a specimen of uncertain origin (Musser, 19816).
Leopoldamys neilli (Marshall, 1976) . Family Muridae: rats and mice, p. 485 . Privately printed by Government Printing Office, Bangkok . TYPE LOCALITY: Thailand , Saraburi Prov, Kaengkhoi Dist, "outside the entrance to the bat cave, half-way up the face of a wooded limestone cliff, 200 meters altitude." DISTRIBUTION: C and W Thailand . COMMENTS: A Thai endemic. See Musser (19816:237) for discussion of original publication.
Lenothrix Miller, 1903 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 26(1317):466 . TYPE SPECIES: Lenothrix canus Miller, 1903 . COMMENTS: Chromosomal and biochemical data suggested a close phylogenetic link between Lenothrix and Niviventer ( Chan et al., 1979 ) , but derived dental morphology is shared with Pithecheir , and spermatozoal conformation is highly divergent from any Sundaic murine. In sum, Lenothrix is a Sundaic endemic characterized by many primitive external, cranial, dental, and chromosomal features and a few derived dental and spermatozoal traits; despite several claims, its phylogenetic relationships still require illumination (see discussions in Breed and Yong, 1986 ; Musser, 19816; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Leopoldamys Ellerman, 1947 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 117:267 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus sabanus Thomas, 1887 . COMMENTS: Definition and contrasts with Rattus and Niviventer provided by Musser (19816), who also reviewed morphological, chromosomal, and distributional characteristics. Leopoldamys is dentally similar to Berylmys , Maxomys , and Niviventer . Sperm morphology united Leopoldamys with Berylmys , Sundamys , and Rattus ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ) , but alliance is based on shared spermatozoal form that is likely primitive. Analyses of chromosomal traits suggested Leopoldamys is more closely related to Bandicota , Berylmys , Nesokia , Rattus , and Sundamys , than to Lenothrix , Maxomys , or Niviventer ( Gadi and Sharma, 1983 ); biochemical data separated Leopoldamys far from Rattus ( Chan et al., 1979 ).

DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Mentawai Archipelago; islands of Siberut, Sipora, North Pagai, and South Pagai. SYNONYMS: soccatus . COMMENTS: L. siporanus joins Maxomys pagensis , Chiropodomys karlkoopmani , Rattus lugens , Iomys sipora , Hylopetes sipora , Petinomys lugens , Callosciurus melanogaster , Sundasciurus fraterculus , and Lariscus obscurus as part of the rodent fauna endemic to the Mentawi Archipelago.
Leporillus apicalis (Gould, 1853) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1853:126 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , South Australia . DISTRIBUTION: Australia : once found in S Northern Territory , C and SE Western Australia , South Australia , and western parts of New South Wales and Victoria , but now presumed to be extinct; extent of former range indicated by specimens caught in late 1800's and early 1900's and distribution of empty stick nests ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988: 159 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981: 152 ). STATUS: IUCN - Extinct.

DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; once ranged on mainland from lower Darling River to Nullarbor Plain in New South Wales , South Australia , and SE corner of Western Australia , and presumed to be extinct; living population on Franklin Isl in the Nuyt's Archipelago of W South Australia ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988: 160 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981: 147 ). STATUS: CITES - Appendix I; U.S. ESA - Endangered; IUCN - Rare. SYNONYMS: jonesi . COMMENTS: Phylogenetic significance of spermatozoal morphology reported by Breed and Sarafis (1978) ; chromosomal morphology described by Baverstock et al. (1977c) . Electrophoretic data indicated L. conditor is phylogenetically closely allied to Pseudomys ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) , but information from analyses of phallic and dental morphology placed L. conditor in same monophyletic group as Conilurus and Mesembriomys , to the exclusion of Pseudomys ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ; Misonne, 1969 ), which is also supported by albumin data ( Watts et al., 1992 ).
Leporillus Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:83 . TYPE SPECIES: Hapalotis apicalis Gould, 1853 . COMMENTS: Member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c:167 ), which includes the Conilurini where Baverstock (1984) listed Leporillus . Mahoney and Richardson (1988) cataloged taxonomic, distributional, and biological references.
Leptomys Thomas, 1897 . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 18:610 . TYPE SPECIES: Leptomys elegans Thomas, 1897 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Most lists and faunal studies published since 1951 recognized only one species in Leptomys ( Flannery, 1990b ; Laurie and Hill, 1954 ; Menzies and Dennis, 1979 ; Tate, 1951 ), but Rummler's (1938) revision in which he identified two species ( elegans and ernstmayri ), and Tate and Archbold's (1938) description of a third ( signatus ) accurately reflects the known diversity. A derived cephalic arterial pattern, along with other morphological features, is shared by Leptomys, Mayrmys , Neohydromys , Pseudohydromys , and Lorentzimys ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). Certain phallic traits ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ), also united Leptomys and Lorentzimys. Chromosomal data were provided by Donnellan (1987) , but whether the sampled species was L. elegans or L. ernstmayri is unclear.
Lemniscomys linulus (Thomas, 1910) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:429 . TYPE LOCALITY: Senegal (= French Gambia ), Gamon . DISTRIBUTION: Sudan savanna and forest clearings in Senegal and Ivory Coast (see map in Van der Straeten, 1980a ). COMMENTS: Once treated as a subspecies of L. griselda ( Allen, 1939 ) , but now considered a separate species related to L. griselda and L. rosalia .
Lemniscomys hoogstraali Dieterlen, 1991 . Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 42:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Upper Nile Prov, Paloich, 12 mi N Niayok . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality.

Lemniscomys bellieri Van der Straeten, 1975 . Rev. Zool. Afr., 89:906 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ivory Coast , Ayeremou (= Lamto) . DISTRIBUTION: Guinea and Doka woodland of Ivory Coast . COMMENTS: Part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). A relative of L. macculus , according to Van der Straeten (1975) , who also recorded chromosomal information.
Lemniscomys griselda (Thomas, 1904) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 13:414 . TYPE LOCALITY: Angola , Jinga country, Muene Coshi . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Angola . COMMENTS: Morphometrically related to L. rosolia ( Van der Straeten, 1980b ) .
Leggadina forresti (Thomas, 1906) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1906(32):6 .

Lemniscomys barbarus (Linnaeus, 1766) . Syst. Nat., 12th ed., l : addenda. TYPE LOCALITY: Morocco (= "Barbaria," see Allen, 1939 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Tunisia , Algeria , Morocco , W Sahara, Senegal , Gambia , Ivory Coast , Ghana , Togo , Benin , Burkina Faso , Nigeria , Cameroon , Sudan , Ethiopia , Kenya N Uganda , Tanzania , and E Zaire . SYNONYMS: aibolineatus, convictus, dunni , ifniensis, manteufeli , nigeriae , nubalis, olga, orientalis (Hatt, 1935, not Desmarest, 1819), oweni , spekei, zebra . COMMENTS: Significance of the considerable variation in coat color and pattern as well as body size among geographic samples will have to be assessed by a careful systematic revision. Closest relative is L. hoogstraali .
Leggadina lakedownensis Watts, 1976 . Trans. R. Soc. S. Aust ., 100:105 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Queensland , Lakeland Downs, 110 km north of Cooktown . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; N Queensland , where it has been recorded only from region of Princess Charlotte Bay and Lakeland Downs (see Watts and Aslin, 1981:211 ), and Western Australia at Kimberley (specimens in the Western Australian Museum; Watts, in litt.). STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: A distinctive species distinguished from its close relative L. forresti by a suite of morphological, biochemical, and chromosomal traits ( Baverstock et al., 1976a ; Watts, 1976 ).
Lemniscomys Trouessart, 1881 . Bull. Soc. Etudes Sci. Angers, 10: 124 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus barbarus Linnaeus, 1766 . COMMENTS: Chromosomal data is summarized for several species by Gautun et al. (1985) and Filippucci et al. (1986) . Karyological and morphological comparisons between L. striatus and L. bellieri are reported by Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1978a) .
Lemniscomys striatus (Linnaeus, 1758) . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:62 . TYPE LOCALITY: " India " (= Sierra Leone ; see Allen, 1939:394 ) . DISTRIBUTION: From Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone west to Ethiopia , and south into NW Angola and through Kenya , Uganda , Rwanda , Zaire , and Tanzania into NE Zambia and N Malawi . SYNONYMS: ardens, dieterleni , fasciatus , lulae, lynesi, massaicus , micropus , orientalis (Desmarest, 1819, not Hatt, 1935), pulchella , pulcher , spermophilus, venustus , versustos, wroughtoni .

Lenomys meyeri (Jentink, 1879) . Notes Leyden Mus., 1:12 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , NE peninsula, Menado . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from N, C, and SW Sulawesi . SYNONYMS: lampo, longicaudus . COMMENTS: Represented by a small extant series from the N peninsula and central core, and by both modern specimens and subfossils from the SW peninsula of Sulawesi (Musser, 19704; 1984). A second species (yet to be named and described) is known only from subfossil fragment collected in SW arm of Sulawesi ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ).
Lemniscomys macculus (Thomas and Wroughton, 1910) . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 19:515 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , SE Ruwenzori, Mokia . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Savannahs of NE Zaire , S Sudan , Ethiopia , Uganda , and Kenya ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: akka. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1979a) . The species is often confused with L. striatus , but occurs sympatric with it ( Hollister, 1919 ).
Lemniscomys mittendorfi Eisentraut, 1968 . Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 19:7 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Lake Oku . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Included in striatus by Misonne (1974) , but treated as a separate species by Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1980) , who also suggested it has morphometric affinities with L. macculus and L. bellieri .
Lemniscomys rosalia (Thomas, 1904) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 13:414 . TYPE LOCALITY: Tanzania , Nguru Mtns, Monda .

SYNONYMS: calidior; dorsalis (Smith, 1845, not Fischer, 1814), fitzsimonsi, maculosus, mearnsi phaeotis , sabiensis, sabulatus, spinalis, zuluensis. COMMENTS: Once included in L. griselda ( Allen, 1939 ) , but now considered a distinct species ( Van der Straeten, 1980b ).
Lemniscomys roseveari Van der Straeten, 1980 . Ann. Cape Prov. Mus. Nat. Hist., 13(5):55 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zambia , Zambezi (= Baiovale), 1015 m (see Van der Straeten, 1980b , for additional data) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality and Solwezi in Zambia . COMMENTS: Related to the L. rosalia complex ( Van der Straeten, 1980b ) .
Lenomys Thomas, 1898 . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 14:409 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus meyeri Jentink, 1879 . COMMENTS: A Sulawesi endemic reviewed by Musser (19704, 1981c, 1984). Simpson (1945) listed Lenomys as a member of the Phloeomyinae along with Coryphomys , Pogonomys , Mallomys , Phloeomys, Chiropodomys, and Crateromys, but no evidence supports this arrangement. External, cranial, and spermatozoal traits tied Lenomys phylogenetically close to Eropeplus, another Sulawesian endemic ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Musser, 1981c ).
Hyomys dammermani Stein, 1933 . Z. Säugetierk., 8:95 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Weyland Range, Kunupi Mt . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; from Weyland Range and Snow Mts in Irian Jaya east along Central Cordillera to Schrader Range and the Mt Hagen and Nondugl region in Papua New Guinea ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of H. meeki ( Rümmler, 1938 ; Stein, 1933 ), dammermani is a small-bodied species with only traces of white wisps about the ears.
Hylomyscus stella (Thomas, 1911) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:590 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Zaire , Ituri Forest, between Mawambi and Avakubi . DISTRIBUTION: From Gabon , Cameroon , S Nigeria , Central African Republic , S Sudan to Zaire , N Angola , Uganda , and W Kenya to EC Tanzania , Burundi , and Rwanda ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: kaimosae. COMMENTS: The new records from Sudan and N Angola are documented by specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History; those from Tanzania are in the British Museum of Natural History. Some east African samples were reviewed by Bishop (1979) . Using electrophoretic traits, Iskandar et al. (1988) documented two species occurring together in NW Gabon . One is stella but they could not place a name on the other. Recognizable morphological variation exists among the samples of H. stella and its significance has to be assessed by critical systematic revision. The variation in 2N and FN among samples identified as H. stella was documented by Robbins et al. (1980) and Maddalena et al. (1989) .
Hylomyscus parvus Brosset, Dubost, and Heim de Balsac, 1965 . Biologia Gabonica, 1:149 . TYPE LOCALITY: Gabon , Belinga, 800 m . DISTRIBUTION: N and E Zaire , S Central African Republic , N Gabon , and S Cameroon (see map in Dudu et al., 1989 ). COMMENTS: A distinctive species discussed by Dudu et al. (1989) .
Hylomyscus denniae (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:144 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Mubuku Valley, Ruwenzori East, 7000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forest islands from WC Angola , extreme E Zaire , Uganda W Rwanda , and Kenya through Tanzania to NE Zambia . SYNONYMS: anselli, endorobae , vulcanorum. COMMENTS: The species was superficially reviewed by Hatt (1940a) and more thoroughly by Bishop (1979) . The records of H. carillus from Chitau and Hanha in WC Angola ( Hill and Carter, 1941:98 ) are based on examples of H. denniae . additional samples (in the Field Museum of Natural History) were collected in the same region on Mt. Moco and Mt. Soque. Although a long way west from the nearest records of H. denniae , most morphological characteristics of the Angolan series fall within the range of variation among samples now defined as H. denniae . That variation, however, is appreciable, especially in body size, and its significance in determining whether one or more species is present in what is now regarded as denniae has to be assessed by systematic revision.
Hylomyscus carillus (Thomas, 1904) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 13:418 . TYPE LOCALITY: Angola , Andongo, Pungo, 1200 m . DISTRIBUTION: N Angola . COMMENTS: Associated with either H. aeta (see Hatt, 1940a ) or H. alleni (see Allen, 1939 ), the affinities of carillus are closer to H. stella (based on our study of the holotype and series from Pungo in the British Museum of Natural History).
Hyomys Thomas, 1904 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1903(2):198 [1904]. TYPE SPECIES: Hyomys meeki Thomas, 1904 (= Mus goliath Milne-Edwards, 1900 ). COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Phallic morphology documented by Lidicker (1968). Photograph and distributional and biological data summarized by Flannery (1990b) . Whether only one or more species are present in this genus has never been satisfactorily resolved ( Flannery, 1990b ; Riimmler, 1938; Tate, 1951 ), but examination of museum specimens revealed the two species listed below.
Kadarsanomys sodyi (Bartels, 1937) . Treubia, 16:45 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Java , Gunung Pangrango-Gede, 1000 m . DISTRIBUTION: Java . COMMENTS: Morphology, natural history, and comparisons with Rattus and Lenothrix reported by Musser (1981a) . Represented only by modern series collected in W Java during 1933-1935, and subfossil fragments from C and E Java ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Among Sundaic murines, Kadarsanomys has no close phylogenetic allies, but some cranial and dental traits suggest a distant relationship with Rattus ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ) .
Hyomys goliath (Milne-Edwards, 1900) . Bull. Mus. Hist. Nat., Paris, 6:165 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., highlands of Aroa River basin . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; Central Cordillera from Mt Dayman in the east to Kratke Mts in the west, and mountains of Huon Peninsula; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: meeki , strobilurus (see Laurie and Hill, 1954 ). COMMENTS: This is the large-bodied species with prominent white auricular tufts that is identified as meeki in the older literature.
Lamottemys okuensis Petter, 1986 . Cimbebasia, Ser. A, 8:98 . TYPE LOCALITY: W Cameroon , Mt Oku . DISTRIBUTION: Known only by a small sample from Mt Oku ( Dieterlen and Van der Straeten, 1988 ; Fülling, 1992 ; Petter, 1986 ).
Komodomys rintjanus (Sody, 1941) . Treubia, 18:310 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara , Pulau Rintja, Lohoboeaja . DISTRIBUTION: Nusa Tenggara : islands of Rintja, Padar, and Flores ; probably occurs on other islands in the Lesser Sunda chain (e.g., Komodo). COMMENTS: Dental morphology tied Komodomys to Papagomys , another endemic of Nusa Tenggara found only on Flores Isl ( Musser, 1981c ; Musser and Boeadi, 1980 ).
Lamottemys Petter, 1986 . Cimbebasia, Ser. A, 8:98 . TYPE SPECIES: Lamottemys okuensis Petter, 1986 . COMMENTS: A distinctive genus whose closest phylogenetic relative is probably Oenomys ( Dieterlen and Van der Straeten, 1988 ; Petter, 1986 ).
Komodomys Musser and Boeadi, 1980 . J. Mammal., 61:397 . TYPE SPECIES: Rattus rintjanus Sody, 1941 . COMMENTS: An endemic of Nusa Tenggara , Indonesia .
Kadarsanomys Musser, 1981 . Zool. Verhandelingen, 189:5 . TYPE SPECIES: Rattus canus sodyi Bartels, 1937 . COMMENTS: The only murine genus endemic to Java ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Leggadina Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:606 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus forresti Thomas, 1906 . COMMENTS: Sometimes included in Pseudomys , but a distinctive genus that is a member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981 c :l 67), which includes the Conilurini, which is where Leggadina is usually placed ( Baverstock, 1984 ). Some species of Pseudomys , namely delicatulus and hermannsburgensis, are often included in Leggadina ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ) but only forresti and lakedownensis belong there ( Mahoney and Posamentier, 1975 ; Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981 ). Data from microcomplement fixation of albumin indicates that L. forresti is so distinct from Pseudomys that it forms a separate clade that is also isolated from all the other Australian endemics ( Watts et al., 1992 ). Morphology of the male reproductive tract, external anatomy of the glans penis, and spermatozoal structure documented in context of comparative study of Australian murines by Breed (1980 , 1984 , 1986), Morrissey and Breed (1982) , and Lidicker and Brylski (1987) . Biochemical and chromosomal data discussed by Baverstock et al. (1976 a, 1981 , 1983b ). Taxonomic, distributional, and biological references for species catalogued by Mahoney and Richardson (1988) .
Hydromys shawmayeri (Hinton, 1943) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 11, 10:552 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , SE Bismarck Range, Purari-Ramu Divide, Baiyanka, 6500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; recorded only along Papuan Central Cordillera from Hagen Range in the west to Mt Kaindi area in the east (localities 1 -4 that were mapped as “ H. habbema " in Musser and Piik, 1982:156 ). COMMENTS: Although identified as H. habbema , specimens from Papua New Guinea were noted to exhibit significant morphological differences from true habbema in Irian Jaya, not only in body size but also in certain cranial proportions ( Mahoney, 1968 ; Musser and Piik, 1982 ; Tate, 1951 ). These and other contrasts support the hypothesis of an eastern ( shawmayeri ) and a western ( habbema ) species, a pattern that is common to other New Guinea murines ( Pseudohydromys murinus and P. occidentalis , for example). Mahoney (1968) discussed the problems associated with the original holotype of shawmayeri , which was described as a species of Baiyankamys .
Hydromys neobrittanicus Tate and Archbold, 1935 . Am. Mus. Novit., 803:8 . TYPE LOCALITY: Bismarck Archipelago , New Britain Isl, Wide Bay, Balayang, Bainings . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from New Britain Isl. COMMENTS: Included in H. chrysogaster by Ziegler (1982b:883) , but it was recognized as a New Britain endemic by Flannery and White (1991) and should retain this status until the significance of its diagnostic traits can be assessed in a systematic revision of the large-bodied forms of Hydromys , as Tate (1951:236) already noted.
Hydromys chrysogaster E. Geoffroy, 1804 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, 93:354 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Tasmania , Bruny Isl (see Mahoney and Richardson, 1988:157 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia : freshwater lakes and rivers as well as swamp, salt marsh, and supralittoral habitats (absent from central Australian region); also found on Tasmania and numerous smaller islands off the coast of Austalia ( Friend and Thomas, 1990 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981:67 ); Kei Isis and Aru Isis; New Guinea : throughout most of the island from sea level to 1900 m (see map in Flannery, 1990b:188 ). Also on Obi Isl in the Moluccas (Flannery, in litt.). SYNONYMS: beccarii , caurinus , esox , fuliginosus , fulvogaster , fulvolavatus , fulvoventer , grootensis , illuteus , lawnensis , leucogaster , longmani , lutrilla, melicertes , moae , nauticus , oriens , reginae. COMMENTS: Considered an Australian member of Hydromyini ( Baverstock, 1984 ). Chromosomal data presented by Baverstock et al. (1977 c, 1983b ). Biochemical evidence supports weak link between H. chrysogaster and Xeromys ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ) . Morphology of spermatozoa and male reproductive tract discussed in context of comparative study of Australian murines ( Breed, 1984 , 1986; Breed and Sarafis, 1978 ; Morrissey and Breed, 1982 ). References to distributional, taxonomic and biological literature cataloged by Mahoney and Richardson (1988:156) . Significance of variation in body size and pelage color needs to be assessed in context of critical systematic revision of the species.
Hydromys hussoni Musser and Piik, 1982 . Zool. Meded. Leiden, 56:157 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Wissel Lakes, Lake Paniai, Enarotali, 1765 m (see Musser and Piik, 1982 , for other details) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; known only from the Wissel Lakes region in Irian Jaya and from the Maprik area in East Sepik Prov. of Papua New Guinea (see maps in Flannery, 1990b:186 ; Musser and Piik, 1982:156 ); limits unknown. COMMENTS: Overall morphology and anatomical propotions of H. hussoni are like those of H. chrysogaster , although it is much smaller than that species ( Musser and Piik, 1982 ).
Hydromys habbema Tate and Archbold, 1941 . Am. Mus. Novit., 1101:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, 15 km N Mt Wilhelmina, Lake Habbema, 3225 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, known only from the type locality and the NE slope of Mt Wilhelmina between 3560 and 3600 m (see Tate, 1951:227 ); limits unknown.
Hydromys E. Geoffroy, 1804 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, 3(93):353 . TYPE SPECIES: Hydromys chrysogaster E. Geoffroy, 1804 . SYNONYMS: Baiyankamys . COMMENTS: Member of the Australian and New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c:167 ). Comparisons with Neotropical ichthyomyines made by Voss (1988) . Flannery (1990b) provided photographs and distributional and biological summaries of species. Phallic morphology of H. chrysogaster and H. habbema described by Lidicker (1968). Mahoney (1968) explained why Baiyankamys is a synonym of Hydromys .
Hylomyscus baeri Heim de Balsac and Aellen, 1965 . Biologia Gabonica, 1:175 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ivory Coast , Adiopodoume . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Ivory Coast and Ghana . COMMENTS: Part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). Distributional and morphometric data summarized by Robbins and Setzer (1979) .
Hylomyscus alleni (Waterhouse, 1838) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1837:77 [1838]. TYPE LOCALITY: Equatorial Guinea , Fernando Poo (= Bioko), Gulf of Guinea . DISTRIBUTION: Equatorial Guinea (Bioko = Fernando Poo ); and W Africa from Guinea (Mt. Nimba) to Gabon and Cameroon ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: canus , simus. COMMENTS: We do not follow Rosevear (1969) in restricting H. alleni to Fernando Poo , and agree with Eisentraut (1969b) and Robbins et al. (1980) in recognizing the species in W Africa (based on our study of Eisentraut's series and other specimens). Robbins et al. (1980) reported sympatry between alleni and stella in S Cameroon , as well as cranial and chromosomal distinctions. However, the morphological differences they noted are slight and variable even with a single sample, the karyotypes have the same 2N of 46 and only differ slightly in fundamental numbers (68 versus 70), and they did not demonstrate that the contrasts did not represent intrapopulational variation. The chromosomal contrasts are not impressive considering that a sample of H. Stella from Burundi had 2N=48 and NF=86 ( Maddalena et al., 1989 ). Some authors ( Heim de Balsac and Aellen, 1965 ; Brosset et al., 1965 ) regard simus as the species distributed throughout W Africa and into Angola , and stella to be the form in C Africa, but we follow Rosevear (1969) in not being able to distinguish any sample that could be called simus. The definitions of both alleni and stella on continental Africa need clarification, as Rosevear (1969) so cogently discussed.
Hylomyscus aeta (Thomas, 1911) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:591 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Bitye, Ja River . DISTRIBUTION: The central forest block from Equatorial Guinea (Bioko = Fernando Poo ) to Cameroon , Gabon , Central African Republic , Republic of the Congo , Zaire , W Uganda , and NW Burundi ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: grandis , laticeps , shoutedeni, weileri. COMMENTS: H. aeta is easily distinguished from all other species of Hylomyscus by its distinct supraorbital shelves. Hatt (1940a) tenatively included aeta , shoutedeni, and weileri in H. carillus but our study of samples and holotypes does not support his arrangement. Variation in body size exists among the samples but its significance has not been assessed by careful study. The range in Burundi is based on specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History. Swynnerton and Hayman (1951:316) listed a record from the Uluguru Mtns in EC Tanzania but we have not been able to verify it. Chromosomal data were reported by Robbins et al. (1980) . Eisentraut's (1969b) grandis from Mt. Oku is a separate species (Hutterer, 1992).
Hylomyscus Thomas, 1926 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 17:174 . TYPE SPECIES: Epimys aeta Thomas, 1911 . COMMENTS: Taxonomic, distributional, and biological summaries of West African forms provided by Rosevear (1969) . Morphometric, distributional, and chromosomal data for some species in Camaroon reported by Robbins et al. (1980) . Species from Ivory Coast reviewed by Heim de Balsac and Aellen (1965) . Distributions of species listed below based primarily on study of museum specimens. See Rosevear (1969) and Robbins et al. (1980) for taxonomic history of the alternating use of Hylomyscus as a genus or subgenus.
Maxomys Sody, 1936 . Natuurk. Tidjschr. Ned.-Ind., 96:55 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus bartelsii Jentink, 1910 . COMMENTS: Definition and contents of Maxomys provided by Musser et al. (1979), who discussed historical allocations of species to groups of Rattus , and summarized chromosomal information. The exclusion of Maxomys from Rattus was also supported by biochemical data ( Chan et al., 1979 ). Morphological analyses indicated that Maxomys shares all its derived molar traits with Berylmys, Mus, and Niviventer, and some of its external features with Mus ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Hypothetical phylogenetic estimate of relationships based on karyotypic data placed Maxomys close to Niviventer and Lenothrix and far from Rattus ( Gadi and Sharma, 1983 ). Spermatozoal morphology of Malayan Maxomys and one Sulawesian species was similar to Chiropodomys and Hapalomys, a configuration also like that seen in Mus and Apodemus ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Breed and Yong, 1986 ). Sperm conformation in the other species of Sulawesian Maxomys were unlike the Malayan species and resembled that of the Sulawesian endemic Margaretamys ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ).
Mastomys natalensis (Smith, 1834) . S. Afr. Quart. ser. 2, 2:156 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Natal, Port Natal (= Durban) . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from South Africa (S and E Cape Prov. , Transkei, Natal, E Transvaal), Zimbabwe , C and NE Namibia (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:268 ); apparently also EC Tanzania ( Morogoro , see Leirs et al., 1989 ) and Senegal in W Africa. SYNONYMS: caffer , illovoensis , komatiensis, microdon , muscardinus , ovamboensis, zuluensis. COMMENTS: Characterized by 2N=32, FN=54 and a distinctive hemoglobin electromorph (Green et al., 1980). Samples with these chromosomal features have also been found in Senegal (Duplantier et al., 1990«) and EC Tanzania ( Leirs et al., 1989 ). This species probably occurs in Angola , S Zaire , Zambia , Malawi , Mozambique , and farther north in Tanzania and perhaps may even range more extensively in W Africa, but at this time samples from those regions have not been identified by linking chromosomal and biochemical data to morphology. Realizing this problem, some regional faunal accounts provisionally list specimens under M. natalensis (e.g., Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 , for Malawi mammals). Listed synonyms are only those pertaining to South Africa for reasons explained by Meester et al. (1986) .
Mastomys shortridgei (St. Leger, 1933) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1933:411 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Namibia , Grootfontein Dist., Okavango-Omatako junction . DISTRIBUTION: Extreme NW Botswana and NE Namibia in the region of the confluence of Okavango and Kwito rivers (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:270 ). SYNONYMS: legerae. COMMENTS: Taxonomy reviewed by Meester et al. (1986:285) . Some workers considered shortridgei closely related to or the same as M. angolensis ( Meester et al., 1986 ) . Occurs sympatrically with other species of Mastomys ( Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ) .
Mastomys pernanus (Kershaw, 1921) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 8:568 . TYPE LOCALITY: SW Kenya , Amala (Mara) River; see Allen (1939:406) and Misonne and Verschuren (1964:655) for details . DISTRIBUTION: Published records are from SW Kenya , NW Tanzania , and Rwanda ( Misonne and Verschuren, 1964 ); limits are unknown. COMMENTS: Ellerman (1941) listed pernanus as a distinctive species of Rattus in the subgenus Mastomys , but earlier Allen (1939) had treated it as a species of Myomys . Robbins and Van der Straeten (1989) claimed this a possibility. Misonne and Verschuren (1964 , 1966b), however, discussed the problem and concluded that pernanus should be associated with Mastomys . Either postulated generic association is unsupported by critical analyses of comparative data so the allocation of pernanus remains clouded. The species is known by very few specimens ( Misonne and Verschuren, 1964 ; 114439 in the American Museum of Natural History is from NW Tanzania ).
Mastomys verheyeni Robbins and Van der Straeten, 1989 . Senckenberg. Biol., 69:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nigeria , Bornu Region, Mudu (see Robbins and Van der Straeten, 1989 , for more information) . DISTRIBUTION: "Known only from Nigeria and Cameroon savanna area immediately surrounding the southern part of Lake Chad " ( Robbins and Van der Straeten, 1989:9 ).
Maxomys inflatus (Robinson and Kloss, 1916) . J. Str. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc., 73:273 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Sumatra , Korinchi Peak, Sungei Kumbang, 4700 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to mountain forests of W Sumatra . COMMENTS: One of the most distinctive species of Maxomys , as reflected by its wide rostrum and inflated nasolacrimal capsules (Musser et al., 1979).
Maxomys inas (Bonhote, 1906) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1906:9 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Perak (Malay Peninsula), Gunung Inas . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic of Malay Peninsula (and possibly Peninsular Thailand south of Isthmus of Kra) in montane forests, rarely occurring below 3000 ft ( Medway, 1969 ). COMMENTS: Once treated as a subspecies of alticola ( Chasen, 1940 ) , but identified as a separate species by Medway (1964) . A close phylogenetic ally to M. whiteheadi , as indicated by morphological, biochemical, chromosomal, and spermatozoal traits ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ; Chan et al., 1978 , 1979 ; Yong, 1969 ).
Maxomys hylomyoides (Robinson and Kloss, 1916) . J. Str. Br. Roy. Asiat. Soc., 73:273 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Sumatra , Korinchi Peak, 7300 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to montane forests in mountainous backbone of W Sumatra . COMMENTS: At one time listed as a subspecies of alticola ( Chasen, 1940 ) , but later reinstated as a distinctive species ( Medway , 1964 ; Musser et al., 1979).
Maxomys alticola (Thomas, 1888) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 2:408 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah (N Borneo), Gunung Kinabalu ("from a high level") . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from two mountains in Sabah , N Borneo (from 3500 to 11,000 ft on Gunung Kinabalu, and also on Gunung Trus Madi). SYNONYMS: kinabaluensis. COMMENTS: The name alticola was once applied to populations from lower elevations on Gunung Kinabalu, the Malay Peninsula, and Sumatra ( Chasen, 1940 ), but was shown to represent a distinct species endemic to mountains of Sabah ( Medway , 1964 , 1977 ).
Maxomys baeodon (Thomas, 1894) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 14:452 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah (N Borneo), Gunung Kinabalu . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from a few scattered localities in Sabah and Sarawak (N Borneo). SYNONYMS: trachynotus . COMMENTS: A very distinctive species represented in collections by few specimens (Musser et al., 1979).
Maxomys hellwaldii (Jentink, 1878) . Notes Leyden Mus., 1:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , NE peninsula, Menado . DISTRIBUTION: Throughout Sulawesi in tropical lowland evergreen rain forest ( Musser and Holden, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: cereus, griseogenys, localis. COMMENTS: Among Sulawesian representatives of Maxomys , M. hellwaldii is most closely related to M. dollmani (Musser, 1991) . Spermatozoal morphology was unlike species of Malayan Maxomys studied, and more similar to species of Margaretamys , another Sulawesian endemic ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ).
Maxomys dollmani (Ellerman, 1941) . Families Genera Living Rodents, 2:218 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Quarles Mtns, Rantekaroa, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Type locality and Gunung Tanke Salokko in the SE peninsula of Sulawesi ; known only from high elevations in montane forests. COMMENTS: Originally described by Ellerman as a subspecies of Rattus hellwaldii , but shown to be a distinct species by Musser (1969c) , and morphologically allied to M. hellwaldii (Musser, 1991) .
Maxomys bartelsii (Jentink, 1910) . Notes Leyden Mus., 33:69 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , W Java , Gunung Pangerango-Gede, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to the mountains of W and C Java ( Van Peenen et al., 1974 ). SYNONYMS: obscuratus, tjibunensis. COMMENTS: Morphology, chromosomes, and geographic distribution reviewed by Van Peenen et al. (1974) ; skull and dentition illustrated in Musser and Newcomb (1983) .
Mastomys Thomas, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 16:477 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus coucha Smith, 1834 . COMMENTS: The historical taxonomic use of Mastomys as a genus or subgenus of either Rattus or Praomys is summarized by Meester et al. (1986) . Important to studies of specific diversity, biogeography, and medicine, samples of Mastomys have been examined in several contexts (see reviews by Keogh and Price, 1981 , and Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). Definition of species by chromosomal and biochemical traits from some regions ( Duplantier et al., 1990a ; Green et al., 1980; Hubert et al., 1983 ) has proceeded faster than definitions based on morphology. The result is a new view of species-diversity in the genus, but also an ignorance of morphological limits of those species and their real geographic distributions. Robbins and Van der Straeten (1989) analyzed all the taxa associated with Mastomys but did not allocate any of them to species. We can tie only those associated primarily with South African samples to species following Meester et al. (1986) but otherwise list no synonyms and refer readers to Robbins and Van der Straeten (1989) . The genus requires careful taxonomic revision.
Margaretamys parvus Musser, 1981 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 168:294 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Gunung Nokilalaki, 7400 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from 6000-7500 ft in montane rain forest on Gunung Nokilalaki, but probably occurs elsewhere in mountainous central part of Sulawesi .
Margaretamys elegans Musser, 1981 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 168:286 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Gunung Nokilalaki, 6500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from 5300-7500 ft in montane rain forest on Gunung Nokilalaki, but probably occurs on mountains elsewhere in central core of Sulawesi .
Margaretamys beccarii (Jentink, 1880) . Notes Leyden Mus., 2:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , NE peninsula, Menado-Langowah . DISTRIBUTION: NE and C Sulawesi in lowland tropical evergreen rain forest. SYNONYMS: thysanurus . COMMENTS: History of incorrect taxonomic allocations of beccarii recorded by Musser (1971 e, 1981b ).
Malpaisomys insularis Hutterer, Lopez-Martinez, and Michaux, 1988 . Palaeovertebrata, 18:246 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canary Islands , Fuerteventura Isl, Cueva Villaverde near La Oliva, at stratigraphic level dated about 1070 before present (see Hutterer et al., 1988 for additional information) . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from the islands of Fuerteventura, Lanzorote, and Graciosa in the Canary Isls (see map in Hutterer et al., 1988). COMMENTS: M. insularis , the lava mouse, has been recorded from sediments dated between 25,000 and 32,000 years before present up to historical times when the species became extinct, sometime between 800 years before present and now (Hutterer et al., 1988; Michaux et al., 1991 ). Reconstruction and study of the postcranial skeleton suggest the species was adapted to living in lava fields ( Boye et al., 1992 ). Boye et al. (1992) reported that about 2000 years before present, Mus musculus was apparently casually imported to the islands by humans who also arrived then, and from that time to the historical period, populations of M. insularis declined and were progressively replaced by house mice. This interaction between lava mice and house mice is the hypothesized causual reason for extinction of the lava mice. Malpaisomys insularis is part of a mammalian fauna endemic to the eastern Canary Islands that includes the shrew Crocidura canariensis ( Hutterer et al., 1987a ; Michaux et al., 1991 ; Boye et al., 1992 ).
Margaretamys Musser, 1981 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 168(3):275 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus beccarii Jentink, 1880 . COMMENTS: Morphological, chromosomal, and distributional features monographed by Musser (1981 b) . Spermatozoal morphology distinctive and similar among the three species ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ). Member of the Sulawesi Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ).
Malpaisomys Hutterer, Lopez-Martinez, and Michaux, 1988 . Palaeovertebrata, 18:246 . TYPE SPECIES: Malpaisomys insularis Hutterer, Lopez-Martinez, and Michaux, 1988 . COMMENTS: Represented only by Late Pleistocene and Holocene samples.
Mastomys erythroleucus (Temminck, 1853) . Esquisses Zool. sur la Côte de Guine , p. 160 . TYPE LOCALITY: Guinea . DISTRIBUTION: Morocco , occurs also from Gambia and Senegal eastward through W Africa to S Ethiopia and Somalia , and south through E Africa to E Zaire ( Kivu Dist ) and Burundi ; southern limits in E Africa unresolved. COMMENTS: Chromosomal (2N=38, FN=52) and electrophoretic data clearly set this species apart from other Mastomys with which it occurs (see Duplantier et al. 1990a , b, and references therein); it is sympatric with M. hildebrandtii (called huberti in the reference) and what might be M. natalensis in Senegal ( Duplantier et al., 1990a ).
Mastomys coucha (Smith, 1834) . Rept. Exped. Exploring Central Africa, p. 43 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , N Cape Prov. , between Orange River and Tropic of Capricorn (see Meester et al., 1986:286 ) . DISTRIBUTION: South Africa (E and N Cape Prov. , Zululand, Lesotho , Orange Free State , S and W Transvaal), S and W Zimbabwe , C Namibia (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:270 ); extent of range beyond this region unresolved. SYNONYMS: bradfieldi, breyeri , limpopoensis , marikquensis , sicialis, socialis . COMMENTS: Characterized by 2N=36 (FN=56) and a distinctive hemoglobin electromorph, coucha occurs sympatrically with M. natalensis , which is distinguished by different hemoglobin pattern and 2N=32, FN=54 (Green et al., 1980). The two species also differ in cranial, phallic, and spermatozoal morphology as well as reproductive behavior, ultrasonic vocalizations, and phermones (see references in Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). Synonyms listed are only those pertaining to samples from South Africa for reasons explained by Meester et al. (1986) ; of these, Robbins and Van der Straeten (1989) regarded marikquensis to be a Myomys , and Robbins (in Meester et al., 1986 ) claimed it may be a species distinct from Myomys verreauxii .
Mastomys hildebrandtii (Peters, 1878) . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin , p. 200 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Taita , Ndi . DISTRIBUTION: From Senegal and Gambia east through West Africa to Central African Republic and N Zaire , extending to Djibuti and Somalia , then south to Burundi and Kenya ; southern limits in E and W Africa unresolved. COMMENTS: According to Qumsiyeh et al. (1990) , hildebrandtii is an older name for huberti , the Mastomys with 2N=32, FN=44. Geographic range is abstracted from the map in Hubert et al. (1983) . This is not the same species as M. natalensis from South Africa which is also characterized by 2N=32, but a different FN (54; Duplantier et al., 1990a ), hemoglobin pattern (C. B. Robbins et al., 1983), and apparently serum proteins ( Robbins and Van der Straeten, 1989 ).
Mastomys angolensis (Bocage, 1890) . Jorn. Sei. Math., Phys. Nat., Lisboa , ser. 2, 2:12 . TYPE LOCALITY: Angola , Capangombe, interior of Mossamedes (additional information provided by Crawford-Cabral, 1989b ) . DISTRIBUTION: Angola and S Zaire . SYNONYMS: angolae . COMMENTS: Sometimes placed in Myomys or Myomyscus ( Allen, 1939 ; D. H. S. Davis, 1965; Hill and Carter, 1941 ), angolensis is more closely related to species of Mastomys ( Crawford-Cabral, 1989b ; Misonne, 1974 ). It is morphologically similar to M. shortridgei and some authors treat the latter as a subspecies of M. angolensis ( Ansell, 1978 ; Ellerman et al., 1953). M. angolensis is either sympatric ( Hill and Carter, 1941 ; Crawford-Cabral, 1983 ) or altitudinally parapatric (specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History from Mt. Soque) with what is probably M. natalensis . CrawfordCabral (1989b) proposed Praomys angolae , which is apparently nothing more than a renaming of angolensis .
Malacomys longipes Milne-Edwards, 1877 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, ser. 6, 12:10 . TYPE LOCALITY: Gabon , Gaboon River (vicinity of Ogooue, Gabon ; see Rautenbach and Schütter, 1978:414) . DISTRIBUTION: Guinea (Mt Nimba) eastward to S Sudan , Uganda and Rwanda , south to NW Zambia and NE Angola . SYNONYMS: australis , centralis , giganteus , wilsoni .

DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Records are from S lowlands and middle altitudes, throughout Central Cordillera from Mt Wilhelm region in the west to Mt Dayman in the east, and the Torricelli Mtns (see map in Flannery, 1990b: 197 ); limits unknown. SYNONYMS: alticola . COMMENTS: Some authors recognized alticola as a species (Lidicker, 1968; Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ; Tate, 1951 ). Chromosomal data reported by Donnellan (1987) .
Malacomys edwardsi Rochebrune, 1885 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, ser. 7, 9:87 . TYPE LOCALITY: Liberia (= Rep. of Guinea ), Mellacoree (= Melikhoure) River . DISTRIBUTION: Sierra Leone , Guinea , Liberia , and southern regions of Ivory Coast , Ghana , and Nigeria . COMMENTS: Part of the murine fauna endemic to West Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). Chromosomal data reported by Matthey (1958) and Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1979b) .
Malacomys cansdalei Ansell, 1958 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 13, 1:342 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ghana , Oda . DISTRIBUTION: Forest zone of S Ghana , S Ivory Coast , and E Liberia . SYNONYMS: giganteus . COMMENTS: Part of the murine fauna endemic to West Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). Rautenbach and Schütter (1978) considered cansdalei a subspecies of M. longipes .
Macruromys major Riimmler, 1935 . Z. Säugetierk., 10: 105 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Eastern Highlands Prov. , Kratke Mtns, Buntibasa Dist, 4000-5000 ft m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; known from a few mid-altitude localities on N slopes of Central Cordillera in Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea , and on Huon Peninsula (Mt Rawlinson); see map in Flannery (1990b) ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Phallic morphology and its systematic significance described by Lidicker (1968).
Malacomys Milne-Edwards, 1877 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, ser. 6, 12: 10 . TYPE SPECIES: Malacomys longipes Milne-Edwards, 1877 . COMMENTS: Study of dental features led Misonne (1969: 106) to write that " Malacomys stands apart from all the other African genera by its unusual dental characters. This is an advanced genus which cannot be clearly related to any other one." However, external, cranial, and dental traits indicates Malacomys to be phylogenetically closely allied with Praomys , particularly through the morphologically annectant M. lukolelae , a species usually included in Praomys and relegated to the P. tullbergi complex ( Van der Straeten and Dudu, 1990 ) . Two revisions (Rautenbach and Schütter, 1978; Van der Straeten and Verheyen, 1979b ) provided somewhat different evaluations of morphological variation and its interpretation in context of specific diversity.
Macruromys Stein, 1933 . Z. Säugetierk., 8:94 . TYPE SPECIES: Macruromys elegans Stein, 1933 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Distributional and biological information summarized by Flannery (1990b) .
Mallomys istapantap Flannery, Aplin, Groves, and Adams, 1989 . Rec. Aust . Mus., 41:96 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Mt Hagen Dist., Korelum ( Flannery et al., 1989 , provided additional data) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; high altitudes along Central Cordillera from Mt Victoria in Owen Stanley Range of E Papua New Guinea to Bele River region in Irian Jaya. COMMENTS: Published records are only from the Central Cordillera in Papua New Guinea (see map in Flannery et al., 1989:97 ), but one specimen (in the American Museum of Natural History, 151342) comes from 18 km N of Lake Habbema in Irian Jaya.
Mallomys gunung Flannery, Aplin, Groves, and Adams, 1989 . Rec. Aust . Mus., 41:101 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, 2 km E Mt Wilhelmina, 3800 m (see Flannery et al., 1989 , for details) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, Snow Mts; known only from vicinity of the type locality and Mt Carstenz (see map in Flannery et al., 1989:97 ). COMMENTS: A very distinctive species known only by a few specimens collected between 2400 and 4000 m .
Mallomys aroaensis (De Vis, 1907) . Ann. Queensl. Mus., 7: 11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., head of Aroa River (see Flannery et al., 1989 , for other data) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Papuan Central Cordillera from Mt Sisa in the west to Mt Simpson in the east; also highlands of Huon Peninsula (see map in Flannery et al., 1989:95 ). SYNONYMS: hercules.
Malacomys lukolelae (Hatt, 1934) . Am. Mus. Novit., 708:13 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Lukolela . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Petter (1975c) recorded lukolelae from Central African Republic , but the specimens we have seen from that series represent an undescribed species of Praomys ; M. lukolelae is still only represented by the three specimens in the type series ( Van der Straeten and Dudu, 1990 ). Originally described by Hatt (1934b) as a subspecies of Praomys tullbergi, but lukolelae's long and very slim hind feet, tip of short fifth digit extending only to base of digital pad of fourth digit, very large ears, cranial conformation, and molar dental patterns associate it with Malacomys, especially M. verschureni.
Malacomys verschureni Verheyen and Van der Straeten, 1977 . Rev. Zool. Afr., 91:739 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Mamiki . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from NE Zaire (eastern edge of Central African high forest block). COMMENTS: Original description was based on one specimen ( Verheyen and Van der Straeten, 1977 ), and the species is still represented by very few examples ( Dieterlen and Van der Straeten, 1984 ; Robbins and Van der Straeten, 1982 ). Chromosomal information reported by Robbins and Van der Straeten (1982) .
Mallomys Thomas, 1898 . Novit. Zool., 5:1 . TYPE SPECIES: Mallomys rothschildi Thomas, 1898 . SYNONYMS: Dendrosminthus . COMMENTS: Listed as a member of the Phloeomyinae by Simpson (1945) , but no data supports such an allocation. Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Revised by Flannery et al. (1989) .
Mallomys rothschildi Thomas, 1898 . Novit. Zool., 5:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., Owen Stanley Range, between Mt Musgrave and Mt Scratchley, 5000-6000 ft ( Flannery et al., 1989 provided additional data) . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Central Cordillera, from Weyland Range in W Irian Jaya to Owen Stanley Range in Papua New Guinea (see map in Flannery et al., 1989:93 ). SYNONYMS: argentata, weylandi. COMMENTS: M. rothschildi and M. aroaensis are thought to be sympatric at a few localities ( Flannery et al., 1989 ), but the morphological variation present among samples requires re-examination to test whether it reflects presence of one or two species.
Lophuromys luteogaster Hatt, 1934 . Am. Mus. Novit., 708:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Ituri Dist, Medje . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from NE and E Zaire (Medje, Irangi, Bafwasende, and Tungula (see map in Dieterlen, 1987 ); limits unknown. COMMENTS: Subgenus Kivumys . References to this poorly known species were summarized by Dieterlen (1975 , 1987).
Lophuromys flavopunctatus Thomas, 1888 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1888:14 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Shoa, probably Ankober (see explanation in Allen, 1939 ) . DISTRIBUTION: From NE Angola throughout Zaire , Uganda , Kenya , and south through Tanzania , to Malawi , N Zambia , and N Mozambique ; an isolated segment in Ethiopia . See map in Dieterlen (1976b) . SYNONYMS: aquilus , brevicaudus , brunneus , chrysopus , laticeps , major , margarettae , rita, rubecula , simensis , zaphiri , zena . COMMENTS: Subgenus Lophuromys . Chromosomal data for sample from Burundi was reported by Maddalena et al. (1989) . The appreciable character variation among samples probably reflects more than one species.
Lophuromys cinereus Dieterlen and Gelmroth, 1974 . Z. Säugetierk., 39:338 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Marais Mukaba, Parc National du Kahuzi-Biega . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Subgenus Lophuromys . Apparently occurs in swampy areas above 2000 m in montane regions of central African Rift Valley. The specific status of cinereus was questioned by Dieterlen (1987) .
Leptomys ernstmayri Rümmler, 1932 . Das Aquarium, 6:134 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Morobe Prov. , Huon Peninsula, Saruwaged Mts, Ogeramnang, 1785 m . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea (above 1250 m in Owen Stanley Range from Mt Dayman west to Kratke Mts and Purosa region in Eastern Highlands Prov. , then northeast to mountains on Huon Peninsula; probably occurs farther west in Papuan Central Cordillera, but limits unknown); Irian Jaya (Arfak Mts only; limits unknown). COMMENTS: A distinctive species distinguished from L. elegans by the diagnostic and distributional traits enumerated by Rümmler (1932) . It is endemic to mountain rainforest and in Owen Stanley Range replaces L. elegans at elevations above 1000 m .
Leptomys signatus Tate and Archbold, 1938 . Am. Mus. Novit., 982:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Western Prov., Sturt Isl Camp, Fly River (N bank), near Fairfax Isis, sea level . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality along lower Fly River ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: The diagnostic traits Tate and Archbold (1938) used to separate this species from the other two identify a lowland population of Leptomys that shows no morphological intergradation with samples of either L. elegans or L. ernstmayri . This species is still known only by the four examples in the type series.
Limnomys sibuanus Mearns, 1905 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 28:452 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , SE Mindanao, Mt Apo, 6600 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Between 6200 and 9000 ft on Mt Apo and Mt Malindang, Mindanao. SYNONYMS: mearnsi . COMMENTS: Known only by seven specimens .
Lophuromys Peters, 1874 . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , p. 234 . TYPE SPECIES: Lasiomys afer Peters, 1866 (= Mus sikapusi Temminck, 1853 ). SYNONYMS: Kivumys , Lasiomys ( Peters, 1866 , not Burmeister, 1854), Neanthomys . COMMENTS: Revised by Dieterlen (1976 b, 1987 ), who recognized two subgenera, Lophuromys and Kivumys (1987). Related to Acomys and Uranomys (our studies; Watts, in litt.; Denys and Michaux, 1992).
Limnomys Mearns, 1905 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 28:451 . TYPE SPECIES: Limnomys sibuanus Mearns, 1905 . COMMENTS: Taxonomic history and past erroneous association with Rattus reviewed by Musser (1977b) , and Musser and Heaney (1992) . Revised by Musser and Heaney (1992) , who considered Limnomys a member of the Philippine New Endemics.
Lophuromys medicaudatus Dieterlen, 1975 . Bonn. Zool. Beitr., 26:295 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Lemera-Nyabutera . DISTRIBUTION: Montane forests of E Zaire and Rwanda above 2000 m (see map in Dieterlen, 1987 ); a montane Western Rift endemic. COMMENTS: Subgenus Kivumys . Information summarized by Dieterlen (1975 , 1987).
Lophuromys nudicaudus Heller, 1911 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 56(17):11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Buia country, Efulen . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from W Cameroon , Equatorial Guinea (incl. Bioko = Fernando Poo ), and Gabon (see map in Dieterlen, 1978b ). SYNONYMS: naso . COMMENTS: Subgenus Lophuromys . Included in L. sikapusi by Misonne (1974) , but is a distinct species (see discussion in Rosevear, 1969 ). Dieterlen (1978b) explained why naso is a synonym. The karyotype of specimens from Cameroon was described by Verheyen and Van der Straeten (1980) .
Lophuromys melanonyx Petter, 1972 . Mammalia, 36:177 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Bale Dist, Dinshu . DISTRIBUTION: S and C Ethiopia , west of the Ethiopian Rift Valley ( Dieterlen, 1987 ) and east of the Rift Valley in the Bale Mtns, 3100-4050 m . COMMENTS: Subgenus Lophuromys . Endemic to Afro-alpine moorland of Ethiopia where it shares habitat with the other moorland specialists Stenocephalemys albocaudata , Arvicanthis blicki , Tachyoryctes macrocephalus, and Otomys typus ( Demeter and Topal, 1982 ; Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden, 1988 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ).
Lophuromys woosnami Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:146 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Ruwenzori East, Mubuku Valley, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: E Zaire , W Uganda , Rwanda , and Burundi ; a montane Western Rift endemic. SYNONYMS: prittiei. COMMENTS: Subgenus Kivumys . The impressive genic differences between this species and L. flavopunctatus prompted Verheyen et al. (1986) to suggest that the two may belong in different subgenera, reflecting Dieterlen's (1976b) earlier conclusion based on morphology. Chromosomal data for sample from Burundi were reported by Maddalena et al. (1989) .
Lophuromys sikapusi (Temminck, 1853) . Esquisses Zool. sur la Côte de Guine , p. 160 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ghana , Dabacrom . DISTRIBUTION: From Sierra Leone through West Africa to Zaire , Uganda , and W Kenya ; also in N Angola (see map in Dieterlen, 1976b:10 ). SYNONYMS: afer , ansorgei , eisentrauti , manteufeli , pyrrhus , tullbergi . COMMENTS: Subgenus Lophuromys . West African samples were reviewed by Rosevear (1969) . Dieterlen (1978b) described eisentrauti as a subspecies in the Bamenda highlands of W Camaroon, but Hutterer et al. (1992) raised it to species rank. Chromosomal information summarized by Gautun et al. (1986) .
Lophuromys rahmi Verheyen, 1964 . Rev. Zool. Bot. Afr., 69:206 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Kivu, Bogamanda near Lemera . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from montane forest in E Zaire (Kivu) and Rwanda above 1800 m ; limits unknown, possibly a montane Western Rift endemic. COMMENTS: Subgenus Lophuromys . Distributional and biological information summarized by Verheyen (1964a) , Van der Straeten and Verheyen (1983) , and Dieterlen (1976 b, 1987 ).
Lorentzimys Jentink, 1911 . Nova Guinea , 9:166 . TYPE SPECIES: Lorentzimys nouhuysi Jentink, 1911 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ). Photograph, distributional and biological information summarized by Flannery (1990b:197) . Phallic morphology described by Lidicker (1968). Analyses of phallic traits ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ) indicated Lorentzimys and Leptomys are related, a hypothesis also supported by dental features and shared derived cephalic arterial pattern.
Cremnomys blanfordi (Thomas, 1881) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 7:24 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Madras, Kadapa . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Sri Lanka and Peninsular India , from S provinces north to Behar and C Provinces. COMMENTS: Once allocated to Rattus ( Ellerman, 1941 , 1961 ), blanfordi is phylogenetically distant from any species in that genus and is related to species in Cremnomys , a conclusion based on dental morphology ( Misonne, 1969 ) and chromosomal evidence ( Gadi and Sharma, 1983 ; Raman and Sharma, 1977 ; Rao and Lakhotia, 1972 ). Chromosomal number and configuration of C. blanfordi are very similar to that recorded for C. cutchicus and C. elvira ( Raman and Sharma, 1977 ) , but differ in amount of C-band-positive constitutive heterochromatin ( Sharma and Gadi, 1977 ). Sody (1941) proposed Madromys , a nomen nudum , for this species.
Coryphomys buhleri Schaub, 1937 . Verh. Naturf. Ges. Basel, 48:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Nusa Tenggara , W Timor, cave deposit near Nikiniki . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Timor. COMMENTS: Known only by subfossil fragments collected at the type locality and from sites in E Timor ( Glover, 1986 ). Related to endemic New Guinea murines and not to species of Papagomys, Hooijeromys , Komodomys , or Paulamys on Flores . Coryphomys buhleri is one of four species, each in its own genus, of giant rats (three have yet to be named and described) endemic to Timor; all are known only by subfossils ( Glover, 1986 ).
Crateromys australis Musser, Heaney, and Rabor, 1985 . Am. Mus. Novit., 2821:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Surigao del Norte Prov. , Dinagat Isl, Loreto Municipality, Balitbiton . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Known only by the holotype .

Coryphomys Schaub, 1937 . Verh. Naturf. Ges. Basel, 48:2 . TYPE SPECIES: Coryphomys buhleri Schaub, 1937 . COMMENTS: Simpson (1945) listed Coryphomys , along with Lenomys , Pogonomys , Chiropodomys , Mallomys , Phloeomys , and Crateromys in the Phloeomyinae, but no data supports such an allocation.
Crateromys Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16: 163 . TYPE SPECIES: Phloeomys schadenbergi Meyer, 1895 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser and Gordon (1981) and Musser et al. (1985). A Philippine Old Endemic in the same monophyletic group as Batomys and Carpomys ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) . Except for a suggested but distant phylogenetic link to Phloeomys that has to be further tested ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ), no data supports inclusion of Crateromys in the Phloeomyinae along with Coryphomys , Lenomys , Pogonomys , Chiropodomys , and Mallomys, as Simpson (1945) indicated. An undescribed species related to C. schadenbergi was recorded from Panay Isl ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ); real distribution in the archipelago and actual number of species in the genus have yet to be determined.
Cremnomys Wroughton, 1912 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 21:340 . TYPE SPECIES: Cremnomys cutchicus Wroughton, 1912 . SYNONYMS: Madromys . COMMENTS: An Indian endemic that was incorporated into subgenus Rattus ( Ellerman, 1941 ) , then arranged as a valid subgenus within Rattus ( Ellerman, 1961 ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ), and finally reinstated as a very distinctive genus related to Millardia ( Gadi and Sharma, 1983 ; Misonne, 1969 ; Raman and Sharma, 1977 ).
Cremnomys elvira (Ellerman, 1946) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 11, 13:207 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , E Ghats, Salem Dist, Kurumbapatti . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from SE India . COMMENTS: Still represented by few specimens from the region of the type locality.
Crossomys moncktoni Thomas, 1907 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 20:71 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , NE Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., Brown River, Serigina, 4500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; known only from Papuan Central Cordillera and mountains on Huon Peninsula (see map in Flannery, 19906:191). COMMENTS: Based on phallic morphology, Lidicker (1968) speculated that C. moncktoni is not closely related to Hydromys and its relatives. Flannery (1990b) provided photographs and summaries of distributional and biological information. Chromosomal data were reported by Donnellan (1987) . Comparisons with Neotropical ichthyomyines made by Voss (1988) .
Crunomys celebensis Musser, 1982 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 174:16 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , near Tornado, 3500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: C Sulawesi ; known only from mountain valley of Danau Lindu and upper drainage of Sungai Miu in Kulawi region. COMMENTS: Known only by three specimens . Morphologically very distinct from Philippine species of Crunomys , and without close relatives on Sulawesi ( Musser, 1982c ). Spermatozoal morphology distinctive ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ), but unrevealing in assessing phlogenetic relationships.
Crunomys fallax Thomas, 1897 . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 14:394 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , NC Luzon Isl, Isabella Prov, 1000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Known only by the holotype . Morphologically more similar to the Philippine C. melanius and C. rabori than to the Sulawesian C. celebensis ( Musser, 1982c ) .
Crunomys melanius Thomas, 1907 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1907:141 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Mindanao Isl, Davao Prov. , Mt Apo, 3000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Mindanao Isl. COMMENTS: Represented only by five specimens , and closely related to C. rabori ( Musser, 1982c ) .
Cremnomys cutchicus Wroughton, 1912 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 21:340 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Kutch, Dhonsa . DISTRIBUTION: An Indian endemic: Kutch, Kathiawar, S Rajputana, and Bihar in NW India ; Mysore, Bellary, and Eastern Ghats in S Peninsula. SYNONYMS: australis , caenosus , médius , siva, rajput. COMMENTS: Ellerman (1961) suggested that australis was possibly a valid species. The complex needs taxonomic revision. Chromosomal information reported by Raman and Sharna (1977), Sharma and Gadi (1977) , Rishi and Puri (1984) , and Sobti and Gill (1984) .
Crunomys Thomas, 1897 . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 14(6):393 . TYPE SPECIES: Crunomys fallax Thomas, 1897 . COMMENTS: Revised by Musser (1982c) . An Old Endemic of the Philippines ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) and Sulawesi ( Musser, 1981c ). Phylogenetically closely related to Philippine Archboldomys ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) .
Crossomys Thomas, 1907 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 20:70 . TYPE SPECIES: Crossomys moncktoni Thomas, 1907 . COMMENTS: Member of New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ).
Coccymys ruemmleri (Tate and Archbold, 1941) . Am. Mus. Novit., 1101:6 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, N slope Mt Wilhelmina, Lake Habbema, 3225 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; Central Cordillera from Mt Wilhelmina in Irian Jaya to Mt Kaindi in Papua New Guinea , above 1900 m . SYNONYMS: shawmayeri . COMMENTS: The species ruemmleri was originally described as a Pogonomelomys ( Tate and Archbold, 1941 ) , but its morphology was so different from the other species in the genus that Tate (1951) placed it in a group within Pogonomelomys separate from mayeri and bruijnii, the species considered typical of the genus. The distinctivness of ruemmleri was reinforced by Lidicker's (1968) study of phallic morphology; others have noted that ruemmleri was not part of the same monophyletic group containing the other species of Pogonomelomys (e.g., Flannery, 1990b ). Finally, Menzies (1990) made ruemmleri the type species of Coccymys . Before the reports of Lidicker, Flannery, and Menzies, the unique character of ruetnmleri had been ascertained by Jack Mahoney, who died before he could finish his revision of the group. The form shawmayeri was described by Hinton (1943) as a remarkable species of Rattus unlike any of the New Guinea species and possibly closely related to Nepal and Sikkim endemics.
Chiruromys votes (Thomas, 1908) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 2:495 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., Upper St. Joseph's River (= Angabunga River), Madeu, 50 m NE Hall Sound, 2000-3000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Papua New Guinea ; S side of Central Cordillera, from Lake Murray area of Western Prov. east to region of type locality, sea level to 1500 m (see map in Flannery, 1990b ).
Chrotomys gonzalesi Rickart and Heaney, 1991 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington 104:389 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , SE Luzon Isl, Camarines Sur Prov. , W slope Mt Isarog, 4 km N, 21 km E Naga , 1350 m . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from W slope Mt Isarog, Luzon, between 1350 and 1750 m . COMMENTS: Morphology, ecology, and comparisons with other species of Chrotomys provided by Rickart and Heaney (1991) and Rickart et al. (1991).
Chrotomys whiteheadi Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:161 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , N Luzon Isl, Mt Data, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Luzon; one specimen is recorded from Irisan, Benguet (see Hollister, 1913b ); all other examples are from the type locality.
Chrotomys mindorensis Kellogg, 1945 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington 58:123 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philipines, Mindoro Isl, 3 mi SSE of San Jose (Central), 200 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Lowlands of Luzon and Mindoro. COMMENTS: Considered specifically distinct from C. whiteheadi by Musser et al. (1982b) .
Coccymys albidens (Tate, 1951) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 97:286 . TYPE LOCALITY: New Guinea , Irian Jaya, 15 mi N Mt Wilhelmina, Lake Habbema, 3225 m . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea , Irian Jaya; known only from the type locality and 9 km NE Lake Habbema, 2800 m . STATUS: IUCN - Insufficiently known. COMMENTS: Still represented only by the six specimens in the type series collected in 1938. Originally described as a species of Melomys ( Tate, 1951 ) , but its diagnostic traits are unlike those defining species within that genus, and similar to those characterizing ruemmleri . This conclusion reached independently by Flannery (1990b) and Menzies (1990) , although neither of them formally allocated albidens and ruemmleri to the same genus.
Coccymys Menzies, 1990 . Science in New Guinea , 16:132 . TYPE SPECIES: Pogonomelomys ruemmleri Tate and Archbold, 1941 . COMMENTS: A New Guinea Old Endemic with uncertain relationships to Pogonomelomys , Melomys , and Uromys .
Chrotomys Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16: 161 . TYPE SPECIES: Chrotomys whiteheadi Thomas, 1895 . COMMENTS: A Philippine Old Endemic most closely related to Celaenomys , and unrelated to shrew rats and shrew mice endemic to Australia and New Guinea ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). Actual distribution in archipelago and number of species in genus still unknown.
Conilurus penicillatus (Gould, 1842) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1842:12 . TYPE LOCALITY: Australia , Northern Territory , Port Essington, sea shore . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; "northern coastal area of the Northern Territory , adjacent islands [including Melville Island, Groote Eylandt, and the Pellew Group], and the extreme north-east of Western Australia " ( Watts and Aslin, 1981:133 ). SC Papua New Guinea in Morehead region ( Waithman, 1979 ). SYNONYMS: hemileucurus , melanura , melibius , randi. COMMENTS: Analyses of external morphology of glans penis and spermatozoal structure and form provided by Breed (1984) , Breed and Sarafis (1978) , and Morrissey and Breed (1982) . Results from studies of chromosomal features ( Baverstock et al., 1977 c, 1983b ), electrophoretic data ( Baverstock et al., 1981 ), phallic morphology ( Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ), and dental traits ( Misonne, 1969 ) supported the hypothesis that C. penicillatus is phylogenetically closely related to Mesembriomys gouldii , and microcomplement fixation data placed it in the same clade close to species of Leporillus and Mesembriomys (see Watts et al., 1992 ). Conilurus penicillatus is one of the few Old Endemic Australian murines that also occurs in SC New Guinea where it is still represented by only two specimens (Flannery, 19906:192).
Colomys goslingi Thomas and Wroughton, 1907 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 19:380 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Uele River, Gambi . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Liberia ( Lofa ), Cameroon , NE Angola , NW Zambia , Zaire , Ruanda , Uganda , E Kenya , S Sudan , and W Ethiopia ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: bicolor , denti , eisentrauti , plumbeus , ruandensis. COMMENTS: Study of external, cranial, and dental variation in context of taxonomic revision was provided by Dieterlen (1983) . Colomys goslingi is a carnivore preying on limnetic macroinvertebrates and small vertebrates, and possesses special morphological and neurological adaptations as well as behavioral repitoire that are correlated with extracting such a diet from streams ( Dieterlen and Statzner, 1981 ; Stephan and Dieterlen, 1982 ). The species is apparently restricted to banks of small flowing streams in tropical rain forest ( Dieterlen, 1983 ), although it has been taken along streams in grassland far from forest ( Hayman, 1966 ). Comparisons with Neotropical ichthyomyines provided by Voss (1988) .
Conilurus albipes (Lichtenstein, 1829) . Darst. Säugeth., 6, 2 unno, text pages and pl. 29 . TYPE LOCALITY: SE Australia (Neuholland); see Mahoney and Richardson (1988:155) . DISTRIBUTION: Australia ; once occurred in a strip from SE Queensland through coastal New South Wales and Victoria into SE South Australia (see Watts and Aslin, 1981:130 ). STATUS: IUCN - Extinct. SYNONYMS: constructor , destructor . COMMENTS: For complete citation see Mahoney and Richardson (1988:155) . Living C. albipes have not been encountered by naturalists for over a century and the species is apparently extinct ( Mahoney and Richardson, 1988 ; Watts and Aslin, 1981 ).
Conilurus Ogilby, 1838 . Trans. Linn. Soc. London, 18:124 . TYPE SPECIES: Conylurus constructor Ogilby, 1838 (= Hapalotis albipes Lichtenstein, 1829 ). SYNONYMS: Conylurus , Hapalotis . COMMENTS: Member of the Australian Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c:167 ) that is phylogenetically closely allied to Mesembriomys and Leporillus (see Watts et al., 1992 , and references therein); part of the group is also designated as the Conilurini where Conilurus is placed ( Baverstock, 1984 ). Mahoney and Richardson (1988: 154) cataloged taxonomic, distributional, and biological references.
Colomys Thomas and Wroughton, 1907 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 19:379 . TYPE SPECIES: Colomys goslingi Thomas and Wroughton, 1907 . SYNONYMS: Nilopegamys . COMMENTS: Hayman (1966) discussed the identity of Nilopegamys with Colomys .
Chiropodomys gliroides (Blyth, 1856) . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 24:721 . TYPE LOCALITY: India ( Assam ), Khasi Hills, Cherrapunji . DISTRIBUTION: Documented from China ( Guangxi and Yunnan ), India ( Assam ), Burma , Thailand , Laos , Vietnam , Malay Peninsula, S Sumatra, Pulau Nias, Kepulauan Tujuh, Kepulauan Natuna, Java, and Bali (Musser, 1979; Wu and Deng, 1984 ), but probably occurs on other small islands of the Sunda Shelf, in Cambodia , and in other provinces of S China . SYNONYMS: ana, jingdongensis , niadis , peguensis , penicillatus . COMMENTS: Variation among some samples in certain morphological features is significantly correlated with geography both on mainland Indochina and islands of the Sunda Shelf (Musser, 1979). The geographic variation in Indochina is reflected in Wu and Deng's (1984) description of C. jingdongensis , based on a small sample from Yunnan , in which a few cranial dimensions average slightly larger than most samples of C. gliroides from elsewhere in its range, but are not otherwise significantly different. Chromosomal data reported by Yong (1973 , 1983 ), J. T. Marshall, Jr. (1977a), and Tsuchiya et al. (1979) .
Carpomys phaeurus Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:162 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , N Luzon Isl, Mt Data, 7000-8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Mt Data and Mt Kapilingan ( Sanborn, 1952a ), but likely occurs elsewhere in mountains of N Luzon.
Carpomys melanurus Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:162 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , N Luzon Isl, Mt Data, 7000-8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Mt. Data, but probably occurs in other highlands of N Luzon.
Chiromyscus chiropus (Thomas, 1891) . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, ser. 2, 10:884 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Burma , Karin Hills . DISTRIBUTION: E Burma , N Thailand , Vietnam , and C Laos ( Musser, 1981b ).
Chiropodomys calamianensis (Taylor, 1934) . Monogr. Bur. Sci. Manila , 30:470 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Calamian Isis, Busuanga Isl, Minuit, sea level . DISTRIBUTION: Busuanga, Balabac, and Palawan Isis. COMMENTS: Originally described as the type species of Insulaemus ( Taylor, 1934 ) . In morphology and geographic continuity, C. calamianensis is most closely related to C. major of mainland Borneo (Musser, 1979).
Celaenomys silaceus (Thomas, 1895) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:161 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , N Luzon Isl, Mt Data, 8000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from N Luzon on Mt Data and Haights-in-the-Oaks ( Sanborn, 1952a ), but probably lives in montane forest formations elsewhere on Luzon.
Carpomys Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:161 . TYPE SPECIES: Carpomys melanurus Thomas, 1895 . COMMENTS: A Philippine Old Endemic in the same monophyletic group as Crateromys and Batomys ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) .
Chiropodomys Peters, 1869 . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , p. 448 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus gliroides Blyth, 1856 . SYNONYMS: Insulaemus . COMMENTS: Revised by Musser (1979). Among Asian murines, phylogenetic position of Chiropodomys is ambiguous. Musser and Newcomb (1983) suggested a phylogenetic link between Chiropodomys and Hapalomys , and a weaker tie to Haeromys . Spermatozoal morphology of Chiropodomys resembles that described for species of Hapalomys , Maxomys, and Haeromys, and is also similar to Mus ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Breed and Yong, 1986 ). Musser (1979) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) recorded other published opinions about relationships of Chiropodomys. No data supports the inclusion of Chiropodomys within the Phloeomyinae—along with Coryphomys , Lenomys, Pogonomys, Mallomys, Phloeomys, and Crateromys— which is where Simpson (1945) listed it.
Chiromyscus Thomas, 1925 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1925:503 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus chiropus Thomas, 1891 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1981 b) , who regarded Chiromyscus as closely related to Niviventer .
Celaenomys Thomas, 1898 . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 14(6):390 . TYPE SPECIES: Xeromys silaceus Thomas, 1895 . COMMENTS: A Philippine Old Endemic in the same monophyletic group as Chrotomys ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) .

DISTRIBUTION: Borneo: recorded only from Sarawak and Sabah (Musser, 1979), but probably also occurs in Kalimantan. SYNONYMS: legatus , pictor. COMMENTS: Most closely related to C. calamianensis in morphology and geography.
Chiropodomys karlkoopmani Musser, 1979 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 162(6):389 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Kepulauan Mentawai, Pulau Pagai Utara . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Pagai (Musser, 1979), and Siberut ( Jenkins and Hill, 1982 ) in the Mentawai Isis. COMMENTS: The largest in body size of any described Chiropodomys , and possibly most closely related to C. major . Part of the rodent fauna endemic to the Mentawi Archipelago (see account of Leopoldamys siporanus ).
Chiropodomys pusillus Thomas, 1893 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 11:345 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia (Borneo), Sabah , Gunung Kinabalu, 1000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Sabah , Sarawak , and S Kalimantan (Musser, 1979), but probably occurs throughout Borneo. COMMENTS: Thomas described pusillus as a species, but Musser (1979) treated it as a distinctive subspecies of C. gliroides . However, the few known specimens of pusillus represent a population of small-bodied mice in which the range of variation of most dimensions are outside of range recorded for all other samples of C. gliroides .
Chiropodomys muroides Medway, 1965 . J. Malay. Branch R. Asiat. Soc., 36(3):133 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia (Borneo), Sabah , Gunung Kinabalu, Bundu Tuhan, 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only by a few specimens from Gunung Kinabalu and N Kalimantan, but probably occurs elsewhere on Borneo. COMMENTS: The smallest in body size of any known species of Chiropodomys ; its closest phylogenetic allies may be C. gliroides and C. pusillus .
Chiruromys forbesi Thomas, 1888 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1888:239 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., Astrolabe Range, Sogeri, 1500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: New Guinea ; endemic to mainland of SE Papua New Guinea (sea level to 700 m ; on N side not known west of Oomsis in valley of Markham River [see map in Brass, 1959 ], and on S side not recorded west of type locality) and d'Entrecasteaux Isis (Goodenoough, Fergusson, and Normanby). Dennis and Menzies (1979) included the Louisiade Isis, but samples in the American Museum of Natural History of Chiruromys from there are not forbesi . SYNONYMS: major , mambatus, pulcher , satisfactus, shawmayeri , vulturnus. COMMENTS: Significance of the appreciable geographic variation in body size and other traits needs to be assessed in a critical systematic review of the species.
Chiruromys Thomas, 1888 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1888:237 . TYPE SPECIES: Chiruromys forbesi Thomas, 1888 . COMMENTS: Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics. Chromosomal and morphometric study, but not a systematic revision, produced by Dennis and Menzies (1979) . Closest phylogenetic relative was thought to be Pogonomys (e.g., Tate, 1951 ), but is not that genus, and remains to be discovered. Flannery (1990b) provided photographs of the species and summarized distributional and biological information.
Chiruromys lamia (Thomas, 1897) . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 18:615 . TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., lower Kemp Welch River, Ighibirei (see Thomas, 1897a:4 ) .

COMMENTS: Placed in the “ Rattus chrysocomus Group " by Tate (1936), in subgenus Rattus by Ellerman (1941: 190) , then subgenus Maxomys of Rattus by Ellerman (1949a:70) and Laurie and Hill (1954: 118) ; but treated as a species of Bunomys by Musser (1981 c , 1991) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) .
Bunomys andrewsi (J. A. Allen, 1911) . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 30:366 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , NE Sulawesi , Buton Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; central core, SE peninsula, possibly lowlands of SW peninsula; limits unresolved. SYNONYMS: adspersus , inferior. COMMENTS: Recognized as a distinct species in the “ Rattus chrysocomus Group " by Tate (1936); placed in the " chrysocomus group " of Rattus by Ellerman (1941) then in the “ coelestis group" of Rattus by Ellerman (1949a) ; treated as a species in subgenus Rattus by Laurie and Hill (1954) ; but included in Bunomys by Musser (1981 c) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) . In morphology and pelage features, B. andrewsi is most closely related to B. fratrorum of the NW peninsula and B. heinrichi in the SW arm of Sulawesi .
Bunomys Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:508 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus coelestis Thomas, 1896 . SYNONYMS: Bunomys ( Grandidier, 1905 , not Thomas, 1910), Frateromys . COMMENTS: An endemic of Sulawesi . Recognized as a genus by Tate (1936), but included in Rattus by Ellerman (1941) , Simpson (1945) , Laurie and Hill (1954) , and Misonne (1969) ; treated as separate genus by Musser and Newcomb (1983) , Musser (1984 , 1987, 1991), and Corbet and Hill (1991) . Phylogenetic relationships unresolved, but part of Sulawesi New Endemics; spermatozoal morphology distinctive although some species resemble that in species of Rattus , but resemblance reflects shared primitive features ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ). Kitchener et al. (1991a) considered Bunomys a very close relative of Paulamys , a Flores endemic; both are probably ecological if not morphological equivalents ( Musser et al., 1986 ). Geographic and altitudinal distributions of species, along with forest types, summarized by Musser and Dagosto (1987) , Musser (1991), and Musser and Holden (1991) . Grandidier (1905:50) proposed Bunotnys for a Madagascar rat, and Sody (1941:260) used Frateromys , but both are nomina nuda.
Bunomys prolatus Musser, 1991 . Am. Mus. Novit., 3001:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Gunung Tambusisi, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from 6000 ft on Gunung Tambusisi, Sulawesi. COMMENTS: Morphologically most like Bunomys chrysocomus , with which it is nearly sympatric (both were caught at the same elevation but in different habitats; Musser, 1991).
Canariomys tamarani Lopez-Martinez and Lopez-Jurado, 1987 . Donana, Pubi, ocas., 2: 10 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canary Islands , Gran Canaria Isl, "La Aldea de San Nicolas de Tolentino" ( Lopez-Martinez and Lopez-Jurado (1987:12) . DISTRIBUTION: Canary Islands , Gran Canaria Isl. COMMENTS: An endemic of Gran Canaria Isl known only by specimens from the Holocene to pre-hispanic epoch (about 2000 year before present). Its congener, C. bravoi is documented by Pliocene-Pleistocene fossils from Tenerife Isl in the Canary group ( Crusafont-Pairo and Petter, 1964 ). A cladistic analysis by Lopez-Martinez and Lopez-Jurado (1987) suggested that C. bravoi and C. tamarani were in the same monophyletic group, one related to the African Pelomys-Arvicanthis assemblage. However, a cladistic analysis by Hutterer et al. (1988) indicated that each species of Canariomys was in a different monophyletic cluster. Careful re-examination of the material will be necessary to resolve these contrasting views.
Bunomys fratrorum (Thomas, 1896) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:246 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , NE Sulawesi , Rurukan, 3500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; NE peninsula only. COMMENTS: Despite Thomas' clear declaration that fratrorum was distinct from chrysocomus , an evaluation also supported by Tate (1936) and Sody (1941), fratrorum was listed as a synonym of chrysocomus by Ellerman (1949a) and Laurie and Hill (1954) . The two are sympatric on the NE peninsula ( Musser, 1970d , 1981c , 1991; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Sody (1941) made fratrorum the type species of Frateromys .
Bunomys heinrichi (Tate and Archbold, 1935) . Am. Mus. Novit., 802:6 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , SW Sulawesi , Gunung Lampobatang, Lambasang, 1100 m . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; known only from montane forest formations on the upper slopes of Gunung Lampobatang. COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of Rattus penitus and listed that way by Ellerman in 1941, but as a subspecies of Rattus adspersus in 1949a, which was followed by Laurie and Hill (1954) . Included within Bunomys penitus by Musser (1981 c) and Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ), and within Frateromys penitus by Sody (1941) , but treated as a species by Musser (1991) and Musser and Holden (1991) .
Bunomys penitus (Miller and Hollister, 1921) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 34:72 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , C Sulawesi , Gunung Lehio, above 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; central core and SE peninsula only. SYNONYMS: sericatus . COMMENTS: Described as a species of Rattus , then listed as a species in the chrysocomus group of Rattus by Tate (1936) and Ellerman (1941) , treated as a subspecies of Rattus adspersus by Laurie and Hill (1954) , and included in Frateromys by Sody (1941) . However, Bunomys penitus is distinctive in morphology and confined to montane forest formations (Musser, 1987, 1991; Musser and Dagosto, 1987 ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Canariomys Crusafont-Pairo and Petter, 1964 . Mammalia, 28, Suppl.:607 . TYPE SPECIES: Canariomys bravoi Crusafont-Pairo and Petter, 1964 (fossil). COMMENTS: Canariomys , along with Malpaisomys , represent the known murine fauna that was endemic to the Canary Islands , and is apparently now extinct ( Boye et al., 1992 ; Hutterer et al., 1988; Lopez-Martinez and Lopez-Jurado, 1987 ).
Heimyscus fumosus (Brosset, Dubost, and Heim de Balsac, 1965) . Biologia Gabonica, 1:154 . TYPE LOCALITY: Gabon , Makokou . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Gabon , S Cameroon ( Robbins et al., 1980 ), and Central African Republic ( Petter and Genest, 1970 ). COMMENTS: Originally described as a species of Hylomyscus , but differs significantly from any species in that genus in morphological and chromosomal traits ( Misonne, 1969 ; Robbins et al., 1980 ).
Haeromys minahassae (Thomas, 1896) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 18:247 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , Sulawesi , NE Sulawesi , Minahassa, Rurukan . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi ; recorded only from the NE peninsula and central core ( Musser, 1990 ). COMMENTS: External, cranial, and dental features clearly distinguish Sulawesi species from those on Borneo and Palawan . Two species occur in C Sulawesi , one restricted to tropical lowland evergreen rain forest, the other (yet to be named and described) found only in montane rain forest ( Musser, 1990 ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ). Karyotype is primitive, spermatozoal morphology is distinctive ( Musser, 1990 ; Breed and Musser, 1991 ).
Haeromys margarettae (Thomas, 1893) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 11:346 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sarawak , Penrisen Hills . DISTRIBUTION: Borneo; known only from the type locality and Sabah ( Chasen and Kloss, 1932 ). COMMENTS: Known only by the holotype and a specimen from Sabah ; record from East Kalimantan by Medway (1977) is a nestling of Sundamys muelleri .
Haeromys pusillus (Thomas, 1893) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 11:232 . TYPE LOCALITY: Malaysia , Sabah , Mt Kinabalu . DISTRIBUTION: Borneo ( Sarawak , Sabah , and East Kalimantan) and Palawan Isl ( Philippines ). COMMENTS: Represented by few specimens. A close phylogenetic relative of H. margarettae .
Hapalomys longicaudatus Blyth, 1859 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 28:296 . TYPE LOCALITY: Burma , Tenasserim, Sitang River Valley . DISTRIBUTION: SE Burma , SW and peninsular Thailand , and Malaya Peninsula; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Karyotype uninformative about phylogenetic relationships (Yong, et al., 1982). Spermatozoal morphology similar to that of Chiropodomys and Maxomys , which also resembled the basic structure found in species of Mus and Apodemus ( Breed and Yong (1986) . Among Sundaic genera, H. longicaudatus may be most closely related to Chiropodomys , based on external and cranial traits ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Hapalomys delacouri Thomas, 1927 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1927:55 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Vietnam , Dakto . DISTRIBUTION: S China ( Hainan Isl), N Laos , and S Vietnam ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: marmosa , pasquieri . COMMENTS: Known only by few specimens.
Heimyscus Misonne, 1969 . Mus. Roy. l'Afrique Cent ., Tervuren, Zool., no. 172:125 . TYPE SPECIES: Hylomyscus fumosus Brosset, Dubost, and Heim de Balsac, 1965 . COMMENTS: A very distinctive genus whose closest phylogenetic affinités have yet to be resolved.
Haeromys Thomas, 1911 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:207 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus margarettae Thomas, 1893 . COMMENTS: A Sundaic and Sulawesian endemic. Cranial, dental, and spermatozoal morphology suggested a distant phylogenetic link to Chiropodomys ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ); chromosomal data was ambiguous in assessing its closest relatives ( Musser, 1990 ).
Hapalomys Blyth, 1859 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 28:296 . TYPE SPECIES: Hapalomys longicaudatus Blyth, 1859 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1972) . One of the few genera with representatives in both Indochina and on the Sunda Shelf ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Hybomys univittatus (Peters, 1876) . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin , p. 479 . TYPE LOCALITY: Gabon , Dongila . DISTRIBUTION: From SE Nigeria (on E side of Cross River ), through Cameroon , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Congo , S Central African Republic , Zaire and extreme NW Zambia to S Uganda and W Rwanda (see map in Carleton and Robbins, 1985:990 ). SYNONYMS: badius , rufocanus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Hybomys . Review of species and comparisons with H. trivirgatus and H. planifions reported by Carleton and Robbins (1985) .
Hybomys eisentrauti Van der Straeten and Hutterer, 1986 . Mammalia, 50:36 . TYPE LOCALITY: W Cameroon , Mt Lefo, Bambului, 1800 m . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Mt Lefo and Mt Oku in W Cameroon (Bamenda-Banso highlands). COMMENTS: Subgenus Hybomys . Definition of this species and its comparisons with others is discussed by Van der Straeten and Hutterer (1986) .
Hybomys basilii Eisentraut, 1965 . Zool. Jahrb. Syst., 92:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Fernando Poo (Bioko), Mocatal, 1200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Bioko. COMMENTS: Subgenus Hybomys . Originally described as a subspecies of H. univittatus , but raised to specific rank by Van der Straeten (1985) .
Hybomys trivirgatus (Temminck, 1853) . Esquisses Zool. sur la Côte de Guine , p. 159 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ghana (= Gold Coast ), Dabocrom . DISTRIBUTION: From E Sierra Leone west to S Nigeria west of the Niger River (see map in Carleton and Robbins, 1985 ). SYNONYMS: pearsei. COMMENTS: Subgenus Typomys . Part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). Morphology, phylogenetic affinities, and geographic range reviewed by Carleton and Robbins (1985) .
Hybomys planifrons (Miller, 1900) . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:641 . TYPE LOCALITY: Liberia , Mt Coffee . DISTRIBUTION: NE Sierra Leone , Liberia , SE Guinea , and W Ivory Coast , west of the Sassandra River (see map in Carleton and Robbins, 1985:990 ). COMMENTS: Subgenus Typomys . Part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). Taxonomic status, phylogenetic relationship, and significance of distribution in Liberian forest refuge reviewed by Carleton and Robbins (1985) . Additional data reported by Gautun et al. (1986) .
Hybomys lunaris (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:145 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Ruwenzori East, Mubuku Valley, 6000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: NE and E Zaire , W Uganda , and Rwanda ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Subgenus Hybomys . Originally described as a subspecies of H. univittatus by Thomas, lunaris is a separate species according to the biometrical analyses of Van der Straeten et al. (1986).
Hybomys Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 5:85 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus univittatus Peters, 1876 . SYNONYMS: Typomys . COMMENTS: Carleton and Robbins (1985) provided a general review of morphometric traits, qualitative features, chromosomal data, geographic distributions, taxonomic assessments, and ecological and zoogeographical discussions of several species, with a focus on West African forms. The species have traditionally been arranged into two groups and reflected taxonomically as either subgenera ( Hybomys and Typomys ) or genera (see Rosevear's, 1969 , excellent exposition). Results of biometric analyses led Van der Straeten (1984) to argue strongly for recognizing two genera. Carleton and Robbins (1985:983) corroborated that dichotomy with qualitative features and chromosomal data, but noted that whether “ Typomys and Hybomys merit generic segregation must await an evaluation of character variation among Hybomys and its near relatives."
Grammomys ibeanus (Osgood, 1910) . Field Mus. Nat. Hist. Pubi., Zool. Ser., 10:8 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya, Molo. DISTRIBUTION: From extreme NE Zambia ( Ansell, 1978 ) and Malawi ( Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ) north through SC Tanzania (specimens in Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard) and Kenya to S Sudan ( Hollister, 1919 ; Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ). COMMENTS: Morphological and geographic definition of G. ibeanus is unsatisfactory, particularly the extent of its distribution in Tanzania. Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) treated ibeanus as a form of G. cometes, but the striking morphological distinctions between samples of ibeanus and the type series of cometes prompted our specific ranking of ibeanus (see also account of G. cometes ).
Grammomys dolichurus (Smuts, 1832) . Enumer. Mamm. Capensium, p. 38 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , near Cape Town . DISTRIBUTION: From Nigeria east to SW Ethiopia , south through N Zaire , Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania , and Malawi , and to South Africa (Natal and Cape Prov. ), and west through Zimbabwe and Zambia to Angola ; limits of geographic range unresolved. SYNONYMS: angolensis , arborarius (of True, 1892, not Peters, 1852 ), baliolus, discolor , elgonis, insignis , littoralis , polionops, surdaster , tongensis. COMMENTS: The number of scientific names reflects morphological and chromosomal variation correlated with geography that suggests more than one species is represented ( Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ; Meester et al., 1986 ); the complex requires careful revision. For example, specimens of true dolichurus from South Africa have duller pelage and more inflated bullae than animals from East and West Africa; should these prove to be diagnostic specific differences, the northern populations should be identified as G. surdaster . The Ethiopian locality is based on a specimen from Kefa (in the National Museum of Natural History) and not on those recorded by Yalden et al. (1976) , which represent other species (see Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ).
Grammomys gigas (Dollman, 1911) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:527 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Mt Kenya , Solai, 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the vicinity of Mt Kenya . COMMENTS: Recorded only by the holotype . Recognized as a species in most lists ( Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ). Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) insisted the species has to be recognized because of its large teeth, an opinion we share based on our study of the holotype ; but the possibility that it may simply be a large individual of G. ibeanus is a hypothesis that deserves testing.
Grammomys dryas (Thomas, 1907) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 19:123 . TYPE LOCALITY: " Kenya Colony" ( Uganda ), Ruwenzori East, 6-7000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: A montane Western Rift endemic: Ruwenzoris and Kivu region in Uganda and Zaire , NW Burundi (specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History). COMMENTS: Originally described as a species of Thamnomys by Thomas (1907a) and listed that way by Allen (1939) . Ellerman (1941) , however, treated it as valid species of Grammomys , which, in the absence of a critical systematic revision of the genus, best expresses current knowledge. Thomas (1907a) noted the diagnostic mammary count in dryas, which, in combination with cranial traits, set it apart from other described forms.
Hadromys humei (Thomas, 1886) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1886:63 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Manipur , Moirang . DISTRIBUTION: NE India ( Manipur to NW Assam ) and S China (W Yunnan ). SYNONYMS: yunnanensis . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1987). Closest relative is H. loujacobsi , known by fossil fragments from early Pleistocene sediments in Punjab region of N Pakistan (Musser, 1987). Yang and Wang (1987) described yunnanensis as a very distinctinve subspecies of H. humei .
Grammomys macmillani (Wroughton, 1907) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 20:504 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , north of Lake Rudolf, Wouida . DISTRIBUTION: Sierra Leone , Liberia , Central African Republic , S Sudan , S Ethiopia , N Zaire , Kenya , Uganda (including Bugala Isl in Lake Victoria), Tanzania , Malawi , Mozambique , and E Zimbabwe . SYNONYMS: callithrix, erythropygus, gazellae, oblitus , ochraceus , usambarae , vumbaensis, vumbensis. COMMENTS: Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) provided historical association of the name with other taxa. Chromosomal variation (under name of gazellae) documented by Civitelli et al. (1989) . The records form Sierra Leone , Tanzania , Malawi , and Mozambique are based on series in the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, and the National Museum of Natural History and represent significant range extensions beyond that outlined by Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) . Judged by Roberts's (1938) description and our study of one of the specimens in his original series ( 24046 in Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard), vumbaensis from E Zimbabwe (Vunba and Mount Seiinda) clearly belongs in the synonymy of G. macmillani rather than dolichurus where Meester et al. (1986) listed it. Matschie's (1915) usambarae from N Tanzania is also likely an example of macmillani because of its small size and short molar row.
Grammomys rutilons (Peters, 1876) . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , p. 478 . TYPE LOCALITY: Gabon , Limbareni . DISTRIBUTION: Tropical rain forest block and outlying patches: from Guinea (Mt Nimba) eastward through Ivory Coast , Ghana , Togo , S Nigeria to Central African Republic and Zaire , then south through Cameroon , Equatorial Guinea , and Gabon to N Angola . Also found on Bioko (= Fernando Poo ) and in forest patches in W Uganda . SYNONYMS: centralis , kuru , poensis . COMMENTS: Usually considered a member of Thamnomys ( Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ), but external, cranial, and dental morphology is more similar to that characterizing species of Grammomys (where it was listed by D. H. S. Davis, 1965, and Misonne, 1974 ), and we include it within Grammomys pending critical systematic evaluation of samples now identified as rutilans . The form kuru , treated here and by D. H. S. Davis (1965) as a synonym of G. rutilans , is sometimes listed as a species (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ), but with provisions ( Hatt, 1940a ; Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ; Thomas, 1915 ); our study of the holotype revealed it is a very young adult rutilans . Tranier and Dosso (1979) reported 2N=36 for an individual captured in Ivory Coast ; this contrasts with 2N=50 usually recorded for G. rutilans ( Matthey, 1963 ) and either signals exceptional chromosomal variation within rutilans or the presence of a morphologically undetected species.
Grammomys minnae Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 . Stuttg. Beitr. Naturk., A, 374:10 . TYPE LOCALITY: S Ethiopia , Sidamo Prov., edge of Bulcha Forest, 1800 m . DISTRIBUTION: S Ethiopia ; limits unknown.
Hadromys Thomas, 1911 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 20:999 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus humei Thomas, 1886 . COMMENTS: Usually considered closely allied to Arvicanthis and its relatives, especially Golunda , but a combination of primitive and derived cranial and dental traits divorces Hadromys from that group: "best hypothesis now available on phylogenetic affinities is to consider the species of Hadromys to have been derived from some late Miocene ancestor, a species of Karnimata , for example" (Musser, 1987:19).
Eropeplus canus Miller and Hollister, 1921 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 34:94 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia, C Sulawesi, Gunung Lehio, above 6000 ft. DISTRIBUTION: C Sulawesi ; known only by small samples from a few places in montane tropical rainforest formations ( Musser, 1970d; Musser and Holden, 1991 ), but probably occurs throughout at least the central core of the island in suitable montane habitat.
Echiothrix leucura Gray, 1867 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1867:600 . TYPE LOCALITY: Indonesia , N Sulawesi . Gray thought the holotype came from Australia , but Jentink (1883) thought the species would prove to be found only on Sulawesi, and Laurie and Hill (1954) listed the type locality as probably N Sulawesi . DISTRIBUTION: Sulawesi : N arm and C core in tropical lowland evergreen rain forest ( Musser, 1990 ; Musser and Holden, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: brevicula , centrosa . COMMENTS: External, cranial, and dental morphology reviewed by Musser (1969b , 1990 ), karyotype of male documented by Musser (1990) .
Diplothrix legatus (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:88 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan , Ryukyu Isis, Amami-oshima Isl . DISTRIBUTION: Japan , Ryukyu Isis of Amami-oshima, Tokun-oshima, and Okinawa (known by modern specimens only in north, but by Quaternary fossils from farther south on island, and from Miyako Isl about 250 km S W of Okinawa ) (see Kawamura, 1989 ). SYNONYMS: bowersii var. okinavensis . COMMENTS: Historical and incorrect allocation of legatus with Lenothrix and Rattus is reviewed by Kawamura (1989) . Phylogenetic relationship, discerned from molar occlusal patterns, close to Rattus and far from Lenothrix ; "phylogeny of this unique genus will be sufficiently understood, when the fossil murids from China , India and Southeast Asia will be investigated in detail" (Kawmura, 1989:110). Chromosomal data reviewed by Tsuchiya (1981) .
Diomys crumpi Thomas, 1917 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 25:203 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Bihar , Hazaribagh, Mt Paresnath . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from NE India and W Nepal ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Ingles et al. (1980) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) .
Diplothrix Thomas, 1916 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 24:404 . TYPE SPECIES: Lenothrix legata Thomas, 1906 .
Echiothrix Gray, 1867 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1867:599 . TYPE SPECIES: Echiothrix leucura Gray, 1867 . SYNONYMS: Craurothrix . COMMENTS: Thomas (1898b:397) explained why Echiothrix is the proper name and not Craurothrix , which he proposed thinking Echiothrix was preoccupied. Based upon shared cranial features, Thomas (1898b) thought Echiothrix was related to the Philippine Rhynchomys and placed them in the Rhynchomyinae. Later workers disagreed (see summary in Musser, 1990 ), and, except to recognize that Echiothrix is an Old Endemic of Sulawesi ( Musser, 1981c ), no one has discovered its closest phylogenetic ally. Spermatozoal morphology resembles that of Margaretamys , Maxomys , and in some aspects even Rattus, but is ambiguous in illuminating possible phylogenetic alliances ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ). Revision of the genus required to determine if N and C Sulawesian samples represent one or two species.
Eropeplus Miller and Hollister, 1921 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 34:94 . TYPE SPECIES: Eropeplus canus Miller and Hollister, 1921 . COMMENTS: Ellerman (1941) allied Eropeplus closely with Rattus , but its nearest phylogenetic relative is Sulawesian Lenomys , an affinity supported by external, cranial, and spermatozoal characters ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ; Musser, 1981c ; Tate, 1936). Spermatozoal morphology of Eropeplus and Lenomys was unique among Sulawesian taxa sampled ( Breed and Musser, 1991 ).
Diomys Thomas, 1917 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 25:203 . TYPE SPECIES: Diomys crumpi Thomas, 1917 . COMMENTS: Misonne (1969) suggested that Diomys is related to Chiromyscus , Dacnomys , and Niviventer (Misonne used Maxomys for this group), but Musser and Newcomb (1983) hypothesized that Millardia , Cremnomys , and other Indian genera may be more closely allied to Diomys ; both views require testing.
Grammomys caniceps Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 . Stuttg. Beitr. Naturk., A, 374:12 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Malindi . DISTRIBUTION: N Kenya and S Somalia . COMMENTS: Karyotype of Kenyan sample described and discussed by Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) , and chromosomal variation among individuals from S Somalia described and discussed in detail by Roche et al. (1984) who assigned their sample to the dolichurus group, but who also, and independant of Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) , noted the distinctive quality of the Somalian species as indicated by chromosomal evidence.
Golunda ellioti Gray, 1837 . Mag. Nat. Hist. [Charlesworth's], 1:586 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Dharwar . DISTRIBUTION: SE Iran ( Misonne, 1990 ), Pakistan , Nepal , N and NE India south through Indian peninsula to Sri Lanka . SYNONYMS: bombax, coenosa, coffaeus , coraginis, gujerati, hirsutus , limitaris, myothrix , newara , nuwara, paupera, watsoni .
Grammomys buntingi (Thomas, 1911) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:381 . TYPE LOCALITY: Liberia , Bassa, Gonyon . DISTRIBUTION: Zone of high forest, coastal scrub or Guinea woodland in West Africa from Sierra Leone and Guinea to Ivory Coast and Liberia . COMMENTS: Except for Misonne (1974) , who included it in G. dolichurus , buntingi has always been listed or discussed as a species of Grammomys ( Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ; Petter and Trainer, 1975; Rosevear, 1969 ). Apparently G. buntingi is part of a suite of species endemic to W Africa: Dephomys defua , D. eburnea , Hybomys planifrons , H. trivirgatus , Hylomyscus baeri , Lemniscomys bellieri , Malacomys cansdalei , M. edwardsi, Myomys daltoni, M. derooi, and Praomys rostratus ( Carleton and Robbins, 1985 ; Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ).
Grammomys aridulus Thomas and Hinton, 1923 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1923:268 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Darfur, Wadi Aribo, Kulme . DISTRIBUTION: WC Sudan ( Dieterlen and Nikolaus, 1985 ). COMMENTS: Usually either listed as a subspecies of G. macmillani ( Allen, 1939 ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Setzer, 1956 ) or included in G. dolichurus ( Misonne, 1974 ) , but considered a distinct species by Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) .
Golunda Gray, 1837 . Mag. Nat. Hist. [Charlesworth's], 1:586 . TYPE SPECIES: Golunda ellioti Gray, 1837 . COMMENTS: Reviewed and compared with Hadromys and Mylomys by Musser (1987). Pliocene fragments identified as a species of Golunda have been recorded from Ethiopia , but Musser (1987) explained why they do not represent this genus.
Grammomys Thomas, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8,16:150 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus dolichurus Smuts, 1832 . COMMENTS: A distinctive genus as asserted by Ellerman (1941) and other workers (e.g., Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ; Rosevear, 1969 ), and unrelated to Thamnomys with which it has often been united as a subgenus ( Allen, 1939 ; Hatt, 1940fe; Hollister, 1919 ; Misonne, 1974 ; Petter and Tranier, 1975 ). Partly reviewed by Petter and Tranier (1975) and Hutterer and Dieterlen (1984) , who provided morphological, distributional, and chromosomal comparisons. Morphological and chromosomal similarities exist with Thallomys ( Olert et al., 1978 ) .
Grammomys cometes (Thomas and Wroughton, 1908) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1908:549 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mozambique , Inhambane . DISTRIBUTION: From Pirie Forest (northwest of King William's Town) in SE Cape Prov. of South Africa north through Natal and Transvaal into E Zimbabwe (Melsetter and Umtali districts) and Mozambique south of the Zambezi River (see Meester et al., 1986 ; Smither and Tello, 1976; Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: silindensis . COMMENTS: The geographic range of G. cometes has been outlined as extending north from South Africa through East Africa to S Sudan ( Hutterer and Dieterlen, 1984 ) but pending revisionary study of the genus we restrict it to the eastern segment of the Southern African Subregion south of Zambezi River (similar to the rang mapped by Skinner and Smithers, 1990:225 ), and consider samples north of that river to be G. ibeanus (see that account). We studied the holotype of cometes and the other specimens in the type series noted by Thomas and Wroughton (1908) ; these animals are on average larger and have more highly inflated bullae than do those from north of the Zambesi River. Ansell (1978) and Ansell and Dowsett (1988) assigned samples from Zambia and Malawi to cometes , but were also impressed with the chromatic and morphological contrast between them and the holotype from Inhambane. The specimen from the Pirie Forest (in the American Museum of Natural History) represents a range extension south of Natal.
Dasymys nudipes (Peters, 1870) . Jorn. Sei. Math., Phys. Nat., Lisboa , ser. 1, 3:126 . TYPE LOCALITY: Angola , Huilla . DISTRIBUTION: S Angola , SW Zambia , NE Namibia , N Botswana ; limits unknown, possibly also occurs in NW Zimbabwe . COMMENTS: Treated by Allen (1939) , Hill and Carter (1941) , and Roberts (1951) as a species, but included in D. incomtus by Ellerman (1941) and most later writers of lists (e.g., Meester et al., 1986 ; Misonne, 1974 ). Crawford-Cabral (1983) recorded sympatry between D. nudipes and D. incomtus in Angola , and our survey of series from Chitau identified as D. nudipes by Hill and Carter (1941:98) revealed it consists of both nudipes and incomtus , qualitative observations supported by morphometric analyses ( Crawford-Cabral and Pacheco, 1989 ). Lukolela and Luluabourg, Zaire , have been included within range of D. nudipes ( Crawford-Cabral, 1983 ) , but specimens from there (in the American Museum of Natural History) are examples of D. incomtus . The holotype and only specimen of edsoni, described as subspecies of D. nudipes from Lukolela, middle Zaire ( Hatt, 1934b ), is an incomtus , not a nudipes .
Dacnomys miliardi Thomas, 1916 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 24(3):404 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , near Darjeeling, Gopaldhara, 3440 ft . DISTRIBUTION: E Nepal , NE India (Bengal Presidency, Assam ), N Laos , and S China (S Yunnan ); probably occurs over a wider range (see map in Musser, 1981b ). SYNONYMS: ingens , wroughtoni . COMMENTS: Known only by a few specimens (Li et al., 1987; Musser, 1981b ).
Crunomys rabori Musser, 1982 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 174:14 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Leyte Isl, Leyte Prov. , Mt Lobi Range, Barrio Buri . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Known only by the holotype .
Dasymys incomtus (Sundevall, 1847) . Ofv. K. Svenska Vet.-Akad. Forhandl, Stockholm , 1846, 3:120 [1847]. TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , "Caffraria prope Portum Natal," (= Durban, Natal) . DISTRIBUTION: S Africa, Malawi , Zambia , Zimbabwe , Angola , Zaire , Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania , Ethiopia , S Sudan ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: alleni , bentleyae, capensis , edsoni, fuscus , griseifrons, gueinzii , helukus , médius , nigridius, orthos , palustris , savannus , shawi . COMMENTS: Possibly a complex of several species. Chromosomal variation from South African specimens reported by Gordon (1991:413) who noted it "is equivocal whether the different chromosomal forms represent distinct species characterized by fixed rearrangements or a chromosomally polymorphic species."
Dasymys foxi Thomas, 1912 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 9:685 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nigeria , Panyam, 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Jos Plateau in Nigeria . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Carleton and Martinez (1991) , who contrasted its distinctive morphological and distributional traits with D. rufulus , the common species of Dasymys in West Africa.
Dasymys montanus Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:143 . TYPE LOCALITY: Uganda , Ruwenzori East, Mubuku Valley, 12,500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Ruwenzori Mtns, Uganda , at very high altitudes; a montane Western Rift endemic. COMMENTS: Usually included in D. incomtus ( Delany, 1975 ) , but distinguished from that species by its altitudinal distribution, long and fine fur, very short tail, and diagnostic cranial traits ( Thomas, 1906a ).
Dasymys Peters, 1875 . Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin , p. 12 . TYPE SPECIES: Dasymys gueinzii Peters, 1875 (= Mus incomtus Sundevall, 1847 ; see Allen, 1939 ). COMMENTS: Chromosomal data summarized by Carleton and Martinez (1991) . Closest phylogenetic allies yet to be determined, but many pelage, cranial, and dental traits of Dasymys suggest alliance with Aethomys .
Dacnomys Thomas, 1916 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 24(3):404 . TYPE SPECIES: Dacnomys miliardi Thomas, 1916 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Musser (1981 b) . Closest phylogenetic alliance may be with Niviventer , particularly with members of the N. andersoni Division of that genus ( Musser, 1981b ).
Dasymys rufulus Miller, 1900 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:639 . TYPE LOCALITY: Liberia , Mount Coffee . DISTRIBUTION: Specimen records are from Sierra Leone , Liberia , Ivory Coast , Ghana , Togo , Benin , E Nigeria , and Cameroon . SYNONYMS: longipilosus . COMMENTS: Morphometric and geographic contrasts with D. foxi presented by Carleton and Martinez (1991) . Relationships with populations from Zaire and elsewhere now treated as D. incomtus bentleyae need to be clarified by critical systematic revision.
Desmomys harringtoni (Thomas, 1902) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1902:313 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , W Shoa, Kutai, Katchisa . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopian plateau between 1500 and 3000 m ( Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ). COMMENTS: Another Ethiopian endemic, and one that is common, judged from the large series in museum collections.
Dephomys eburnea (Heim de Balsac et Bellier, 1967) . Mammalia, 31:157 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ivory Coast , Lamto . DISTRIBUTION: Records are from Ivory Coast and Liberia . COMMENTS: Originally described as a subspecies of defua (see discussion and references in Rosevear, 1969 ), but shown to be a separate species by Van der Straeten (1984) . Part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). Chromosomal data reported by Tranier and Dosso (1979) .
Dephomys defua (Miller, 1900) . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:635 . TYPE LOCALITY: Liberia , Mt Coffee . DISTRIBUTION: Specimens are from Sierra Leone , Guinea (Mt Nimbo), Liberia , Ivory Coast , and Ghana . COMMENTS: Part of the murine fauna endemic to W Africa (see account of Grammomys buntingi ). Taxonomy, morphology, range, and habits reviewed by Rosevear (1969) and Van der Straeten (1984) .
Dephomys Thomas, 1926 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 17:177 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus defua Miller, 1900 . COMMENTS: Another genus founded by Thomas and either relegated to Rattus as a subgenus or combined with Stochomys , which was then treated as a subgenus of either Rattus or Aethomys (see discussions in D. H. S. Davis, 1965; Rosevear, 1969 ; and Van der Straeten, 1984 ). The generic integrity of Dephomys was recognized by Misonne (1969) and Rosevear (1969) , who also suggested it was not especially closely related to Stochomys , which was the conventional view. Molar characters and morphometric data clearly point to Hybomys as the closest phylogenetic ally of Dephomys ( Misonne, 1969 ; Van der Straeten, 1984 ).
Desmomys Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 5:284 . TYPE SPECIES: Pelomys harringtoni Thomas, 1902 . COMMENTS: Listed as a genus by Allen (1939) , but usually treated as a subgenus of Pelomys ( Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ). Most of the diagnostic traits described by Thomas (1910b) are outside the range of morphological variation seen among species of Pelomys . Our study of specimens revealed that general external traits and cranial conformation of D. harringtoni , the only species in the genus, resemble species of Mylomys and Pelomys , but that Desmomys has its own derived dental patterns (ridge-like cusp t9 connecting central cusp t8 with labial cusp t6 on first and second molars, ridge-like cusp t7 on second upper molar). The phylogenetic relationships among species of Desmomys , Pelomys , and Mylomys has to be assessed by revisionary study. See the account of Mylomys for the status of rex , which is usually placed in Desmomys ( Yalden et al., 1976 ) .
Apodemus hermonensis Filippucci, Simson, and Nevo, 1989 . Boll. Zool., 56:374 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mt Hermon, Israel . DISTRIBUTION: Alpine "tragacanthic" belt at about 2000 m on Mt Hermon, but may also occur in Lebanon ( Filippucci et al., 1989 ). COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . Morphologically and genetically closely related to A. flavicollis , which it displaces on Mt Hermon (and possibly also Lebanon and Antilebanon mountain ranges) at elevations above 1900 m ( Filippucci et al., 1989 ).
Apodemus gurkha Thomas, 1924 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 29:888 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nepal , Gorkha, Laprak . DISTRIBUTION: Nepal . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alsomys . Reviewed and contrasted with A. sylvaticus by Martens and Niethammer (1972) . Chromosomal data reported and contrasted with other Apodemus by Gemmeke and Niethammer (1983). Also listed as a distinct species by Corbet (1978c) and Corbet and Hill (1991) .
Apodemus draco (Barrett-Hamilton, 1900) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1900:418 . TYPE LOCALITY: S China , NW Fujian , Kuatun . DISTRIBUTION: China ( Hebei , SW Fujian , Henan , Shanxi , Shaanxi , Ninxia, Gansu , Yunnan , Sichuan , Guizhou , Xixang), Burma , and India ( Assam ). SYNONYMS: argenteus (Swinhoe, not Temminck), bodius, ilex , orestes . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alsomys . Originally described as a subspecies of sylvaticus , and listed that way by Allen (1940:945) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951:571) , but correctly listed as a separate species by Ellerman (1941:101) , Corbet (1978c:137) , Corbet and Hill (1991) , and Xia (1985) , who also noted the close relationship between A. draco and A. argenteus .
Apodemus chevrieri (Milne-Edwards, 1868) . Rech. Hist. Nat. Mammifères, p. 288 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Sichuan , Moupin . DISTRIBUTION: W China , from W Hubei and S Gansu south through Sichuan into N and C Yunnan . COMMENTS: Subgenus Apodemus . Included in A. agrarius by Allen (1940), Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , and Corbet (1978c) , but was earlier correctly listed as a species by Ellerman (1941:102) . Currently recognized as a species distinct from A. agrarius by Xia (1984) , Wang (1985b) , and Yang and Fang (1988) . Sympatric with A. agrarius in Sichuan and Ghizhou provinces ( Wang, 1985b ; Xia, 1985 ).
Apodemus flavicollis (Melchior, 1834) . Dansk. Staat. Norg. Pattedyr, p. 99 . TYPE LOCALITY: Denmark , Sieland Isl . DISTRIBUTION: England and Wales , from NW Spain, France , Denmark , S Scandinavia through European Russia to Urals, S Italy , the Balkans, Syria , Lebanon , and Israel ( Corbet, 1978c:134 ); also Netherlands ( Van der Straeten, 1977 ). SYNONYMS: brauneri, cellarius , dietzi, fennicus, geminae, princeps , saturatus , wintoni. COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . B chromosome polymorphism among populations reported by Vujosevic et al. (1991) . European populations reviewed by Niethammer (1978b) . Syrian, Lebanese, and Israeli populations should be re-examined to see if they represent A. fulvipectus , or another species, rather than A. flavicollis .
Apodemus fulvipectus Ognev, 1924 . Rodentia of N Caucasus, Rostov-on-Don, p. 47 . TYPE LOCALITY: Georgia , N Caucasus, Dusheti Dist., near Kobi . DISTRIBUTION: From E of the Dnepr River in the Ukraine , the Crimea , through Russia into the N Caucasus, Trancaucasus ( Georgia , Armenia , and Azervaijan) and possibly in N Turkey , N Iran , and east to Kopet-Dag Mts ( Mezhzherin and Zagorodnyuk, 1989 ). SYNONYMS: chorassanicus, falzfeini . COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . Mezhzherin and Zagorodnyuk (1989) described falzfeini as a species, which O. Rossolimo (in litt.) considered to be the same as A. fulvipectus . Subsequent results from genetic studies led Mezhzherin and Zykov (1991) to treat falzfeini as identical with chorassanicus, which was originally described as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus . Vorontsov et al. (1992) recognized fulvipectus as the oldest name for this species; it was one of the electrophoretic siblings in the Caucasus revealed by Vorontsov et al. (1989) .
Apodemus ponticus Sviridenko, 1936 . Abs. Works Zool. Inst. Moscow State Univ., 3:103 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Caucasus, Chernomorski Dist., (Black Sea) Olgino Village . DISTRIBUTION: From shore of Azov Sea through Ciscaucasia, south through Caucasus into Armenia , E Turkey , Iraq , and possibly NW Iran ; limits unknown. Parts of the Russian distribution were mapped by Vereshchagin (1967 ; as fulvipectus ), Mezhzherin (1991), and Vorontsov et al. (1992) . SYNONYMS: argyropuli, argyropuloi, brevicauda , parvus , persicus , planicola, samaricus, samariensis, saxatilis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . The names above have been associated with A. flavicollis ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Harrison and Bates, 1991 ), but they identify samples of A. ponticus which is a distinct species ( Bobrinskii et al., 1944 ; Mezhzherin, 1991; O. Rossolimo, in litt.; Vereshchagin, 1967:510 ; Vorontsov et al., 1992 ). True flavicollis does not occur in the Caucasus and parts of the M East. The names argyropuli Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 , and argyropuloi Heptner, 1948 (see Harrison and Bates, 1991 ) were proposed to replace parvus .
Apodemus hyrcanicus Vorontsov, Boyeskorov, and Mezhzherin, 1992 . Zool. Zh., 71:127 . TYPE LOCALITY: Azerbaijan , Caucasus, Astarinski (R-NO), Hirkauski Preserve, "Piavolil" Dist., 450 m . DISTRIBUTION: E Caucasus (see map in Vorontsov et al., 1992: 124 ) where it is apparently endemic in the low mountain broadleaf forests of the Talysh region. COMMENTS: Apodemus hyrcanicus , along with A. uralensis , A. fulvipectus , and A. ponticus , are all found in the Caucasus and have recently been revised by Vorontsov et al. (1992) using chromosomal, biochemical, and morphological characters.
Apodemus latronum Thomas, 1911 . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 100:49 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , W Szechwan, Tatsienlu . DISTRIBUTION: China (E Xizang , Sichuan , Yunnan ) and N Burma . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alsomys . Treated as a subspecies of A. draco by Feng et al. (1986) , but latronum is a separate species that is sympatric with draco in Sichuan ( Corbet, 1978c ).
Apodemus peninsulae (Thomas, 1907) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1906:862 [1907]. TYPE LOCALITY: Korea , 110 m SE of Seoul , Mingyoung . DISTRIBUTION: SE Siberia from NE China ( Xinjiang ) and Altai Mtns to Ussuri, south through NE China and Korea , and E Mongolia to SW China ( Sichuan and E Xizang ); also on N Japanese islands of Sakhalin and Hokkaido. SYNONYMS: giliacus, major , majusculus, nigritalus , praetor , qinghaiensis, rufulus , sowerbyi . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alsomys . The Chinese qinghaiensis was described as a subspecies ( Feng et al., 1983 ). Results of B-chromosomal analyses and references to chromosomal studies of A. peninsulae provided by Kolomiets et al. (1988) and Borisov and Malygin (1991) . Biochemical systematics in reference to A. speciosus and the Hokkaido giliacus reported by Saitoh et al. (1989) , who also reviewed the contrasting treatment of giliacus as either a subspecies of A. peninsulae or a separate species, and its bigeographical implications. Corbet (1978c) listed nigritalus as a synonym of A. sylvaticus , but the holotype is A. peninsulae (also see Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987:221 ). A. peninsulae nigritalus is sympatric with the smaller-bodied A. uralensis tscherga in the Altai region , which Hollister had noted (but under different names) in 1913b (see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:567 ). Placed in subgenus Apodemus by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) and Mezhzherin and Zykov (1991) .
Apodemus mystacinus (Danford and Alston, 1877) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1877:279 . TYPE LOCALITY: Turkey , Adana Prov. , Bulgar Dagh Mt, Zebil . DISTRIBUTION: SE Europe, Israel , Lebanon , Jordan , Iraq , Iraq , NW Iran , S Georgia in Caucasus, Rhodes, Crete, and other inshore Aegean isls, and N Arabia ( Corbet, 1978c ; Niethammer, 1978a ). SYNONYMS: epimelas , euxinus, pohlei, rhodius, smyrnensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Karstomys . Reviewed by Storch (1977) and Niethammer (1978a) , who included krkensis as a subspecies; that form, however, is a color phase of A. sylvaticus (see that account). The Arabian portion of its range includes the form named pohlei ( Harrison and Bates, 1991 ). Vorontsov et al. (1989) provided chromosomal data in context of defining species in Caucasia.
Apodemus Kaup, 1829 . Skizz. Entwickel.-Gesch. Nat. Syst. Europ. Thierwelt, 1:154 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus agrarius Pallas, 1771 . SYNONYMS: Alsomys , Karstomys , Nemomys , Petromys , Sylvaemus . COMMENTS: Palaearctic species reviewed by Corbet (1978c , 1984 ) and Kobayashi (1985) , Chinese species by Xia (1984 , 1985 ). Recognized species have been allocated among the subgenera Apodemus , Sylvaemus , Alsomys , and Karstomys ( Corbet, 1978c ; Zimmermann, 1962 ) but whether these names designate monophyletic clusters and should be retained as subgenera or instead raised to generic rank remains to be answered by critical systematic revision of the entire group, which is currently unavailable. Most taxonomists recognize at least the subgeneric validity of Apodemus and Sylvaemus ; some suggest Sylvaemus should be raised to generic rank because of its great morphological and genic divergence from Apodemus ( Britton-Davidian et al., 1991 ; Mezhzherin and Zykov, 1991 ); others treat Sylvaemus as a separate genus ( Bonhomme et al., 1985 ; Mezhzherin and Lashkova, 1992 ). Phallic morphological comparisons among five European species provided by Williams et al. (1980) and among Chinese species documented by Yang and Fang (1988) . Taxonomic differences in testes size among European species documented by Kratochvil (1971) . Comparative chromosomal studies among European species provided by Soldatovic et al. (1975) , Bekasova et al. (1980) , and Vujosevic et al. (1984) ; chromosomal contrasts among Japanese species presented by Tsuchiya (1981) . Electrophoretic variations of enzymes among species of Apodemus documented by Darviche et al. (1979 , and references cited therein), Gemmeke (1980) , Gill et al. (1987) , and Fraguedakis-Tsolis (1983) in systematic context; electrophoretic, karyological, and morphological distinctions among several species reported by Vorontsov et al. (1989) and Britton-Davidian et al. (1991) . Differences in restriction endonuclease of nuclear DNA from three Austrian species reported by Csaikl et al. (1990) . DNA-DNA hybridization results from analyses of three species presented by Catzeflis et al. (1987) and Catzeflis (1990) . Numerous taxonomic provincial studies described morphological and other distinctions among sympatric species of Apodemus ; examples are the study of five species from Bulgaria by Popov (1981) , three species from Poland by Ruprecht (1979) , and two species from Korea by Koh (1988) and Park et al. (1990) . Vorontsov et al. (1989) described the presence of five species in the Caucasus, some of which were distinguished only by biochemical traits; Vorontsov et al. (1992) recently identified and defined four species from there. Tchernov (1979) reported on polymorphism, size trends and Pleistocene paleoclimatic responses of three Israeli species in an evolutionary context.
Anonymomys mindorensis Musser, 1981 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 168:300 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Mindoro Isl, Halcon Range, Hong Peak, 4500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: An endemic of Mindoro Island phylogenetically more closely related to native Sundaic murines than to any Philippine endemic ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Anisomys imitator Thomas, 1904 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1903:200 [1904]. TYPE LOCALITY: Papua New Guinea , Central Prov., Aroa River, Avera . DISTRIBUTION: Forested mountain backbone of mainland New Guinea . COMMENTS: Flannery (1990b) provided a description of the species and a distribution map. Chromosomal data reported by Donnellan (1987) .
Aethomys thomasi (de Winton, 1897) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 20:327 . TYPE LOCALITY: Angola , Galanga . DISTRIBUTION: W and C Angola . COMMENTS: A distinctive species related to A. kaiseri . Distribution of A. thomasi is mostly parapatric with A. kaiseri although Crawford-Cabral (1986) suspected it overlaps in the central highlands.
Aethomys stannarius Thomas, 1913 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 11:482 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Nigeria , Bauchi Prov. , Kabwir . DISTRIBUTION: N Nigeria to W Cameroon . COMMENTS: A West African endemic that was included in A. hindei by Davis (1975b) , but was correctly treated as a distinct species by Ellerman (1941: 145) , Rosevear (1969:389) , and Hutterer and Joger (1982: 126) .
Anisomys Thomas, 1904 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1903(2):199 [1904]. TYPE SPECIES: Anisomys imitator Thomas, 1904 . COMMENTS: Lidicker (1968) documented phallic morphology of Anisomys and other New Guinea endemic murines, and concluded that the phallic morphology of Anisomys retained a high proportion of ancestral states. Used as the type genus of Tribe Anisomyini by Lidicker and Brylski (1987) . Member of the New Guinea Old Endemics ( Musser, 1981c ).
Anonymomys Musser, 1981 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 168:300 . TYPE SPECIES: Anonymomys mindorensis Musser, 1981 .
Apodemus arianus (Blandord, 1881) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 7:162 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Persia ( Iran ), Kohrud . DISTRIBUTION: From N Iran west through Iraq to Lebanon and N Israel (see Harrison and Bates, 1991 ); limits unknown. SYNONYMS: erythronotus , witherbyi . COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . Usually listed as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 : Harrison and Bates, 1991 ), we separate it on the basis of its distinctive pelage and smaller body size. Both arianus and a larger, darker form (possibly wardi ) occur in N Iran , although Lay (1967:186) considered them ecological subspecies. The relationship between arianus , wardi , and the small A. uralensis requires taxonomic resolution. A. arianus may be the species represented by the sample from Qazvin , N Iraq , that Darviche et al. (1979) separated electrophoretically from A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis , but still considered closer to the latter. Vorontsov et al. (1992) included arianus in A. uralensis .
Apodemus agrarius (Pallas, 1771) . Reise Prov. Russ. Reichs., 1:454 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Ulianovsk Obi, middle Volga River, Ulianovsk (formerly Simbirsk) .

Apodemus argenteus (Temminck, 1844) . In Siebold, Temminck, and Schlegel, Fauna Japonica, Arnz et Socii, Lugduni Batavorum, p. 51 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan . DISTRIBUTION: Japan ; the four main islands along with some of the smaller ones ( Corbet, 1978c:136 ). SYNONYMS: celatus , geisha , hokkaidi, sagax , tanei, yakui. COMMENTS: Subgenus Alsomys , but subgeneric allocation was questioned by Corbet (1978c:136) . Because the type-series of Mus argenteus Temminck, 1844 is composite, a lectotype was chosen by Smeenk et al. (1982) , which stabilizes the name of this species. Year of publication of argenteus is usually listed as 1845 but description appeared in 1844 ( Smeenk et al., 1982 ). Electrophoretic analyses of 17 enzymes reported by Saitoh et al. (1989) in context of biochemical systematics of Japanese Apodemus . Chromosomal and morphometric comparisons between A. argenteus and other Japanese Apodemus reviewed by Vorontsov et al. (1977a) .

SYNONYMS: selousi , transvaalensis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Revised by Dippenaar and Rautenbach (1986) . Interpretation of genic data indicated A. spinosissimus should be placed in a species-group separate from other Acomys ( Janecek et al., 1991 ) .
Aethomys chrysophilus (de Winton, 1897) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1896:801 [1897]. TYPE LOCALITY: S Zimbabwe , Mashonaland , Mazoe .

SYNONYMS: alticola , capricornis, fouriei, harei, imago, ineptus , magalakuini, pretoriae, singidae, tongensis, tzaneenensis, voi . COMMENTS: Data from chromosomes ( Gordon and Rautenbach, 1980 ; Visser and Robinson, 1986 ) and spermatozoal morphology ( Gordon and Watson, 1986 ; Visser and Robinson, 1987 ) indicated that populations now identified as A. chrysophilus consist of two species: chrysophilus itself and another species not yet identified by scientific name.

Acomys wilsoni Thomas, 1892 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 10:22 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Mombasa . DISTRIBUTION: S Sudan , S Ethiopia , S Somalia , Kenya , and south to EC Tanzania (Kondoa; specimens in the American Museum of Natural History); limits unknown. SYNONYMS: ablutus , argillaceus, boronei, enid, nubilus. COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Formerly included in subspinosus by Setzer (1975) but considered a species by Hollister (1919) , Ellerman (1941) , Matthey (1968) , Yalden et al. (1976) , Rupp (1980) , Petter and Roche (1981) , Petter (1983) , and Corbet and Hill (1991) . Genically most similar to A. percivali ( Janecek et al., 1991 ) . Specimens of nubilus are larger and longer-tailed than wilsoni and may represent a separate species; de Beaux's (1934) description of boronei recalls nubilus.
Aethomys bocagei (Thomas, 1904) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 13:416 . TYPE LOCALITY: Angola , Pungo Andongo . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from C and W Angola ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Morphology is very similar to A. silindensis (see that account).
Aethomys Thomas, 1915 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 16:477 . TYPE SPECIES: Epimys hindei Thomas, 1902 . SYNONYMS: Micaelamys . COMMENTS: Genus uncritically reviewed by Ellerman (1941) , more fully by Davis (1975b) , and still requires careful systematic revision to understand specific diversity, geographic distributions, and phylogenetic relationships of the genus with other African murines. Micaelamys is traditionally used as a subgenus for A. granti and A. namaquensis , but the characters separating them from other species in Aethomys are no more significant than the traits distinguishing those other species. Chromosomal data for various species provided by Matthey (1964) and Baker et al. (1988c) .
Aethomys granfi (Wroughton, 1908) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 1:257 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Deelfontein . DISTRIBUTION: South Africa , known only from SC Cape Prov. (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:279 ). COMMENTS: Meester et al. (1986:292) provided historical taxonomic allocations of granti , which ranged from Myomys , through Rattus and Mastomys to Aethomys . Reviewed and compared with A. namaquensis , its closest relative, by Skinner and Smithers (1990) .
Aethomys hindei (Thomas, 1902) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:218 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Machakos . DISTRIBUTION: N Camaroon, N and NE Zaire , S Sudan , SW Ethiopia , Uganda , Kenya , and Tanzania (no farther south than Muanza); southern limits unresolved. SYNONYMS: alghazal, centralis , helleri , medicatus , norae . COMMENTS: Originally described as a species but later incorrectly arranged as a subspecies of A. kaiseri (e.g., Hollister, 1919 ; Swynnerton and Hayman, 1951 ) with which it is sympatric. Actual geographic range of A. hindei is unresolved because many series in museum collections and reported in the literature are misidentified as A. kaiseri . See Bekele and Schütter (1989) for discussion of the Ethiopian record. Davis (19756) recognized two discrete populations, one to the east of the Rift Valley, and one to the west. The complex requires revisionary study to determine significance of appreciable geographic variation in morphological traits among samples.
Aethomys namaquensis (A. Smith, 1834) . S. Afr. Quart. J., 2:160 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , Cape Prov. , Namaqualand, Cape of Good Hope . DISTRIBUTION: S Angola , South Africa (except parts of Cape Prov. , coastal Natal, and Namib Desert), Botswana , Zimbabwe , S and C Mozambique , S Malawi , and SE Zambia (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:278 ). SYNONYMS: arborarius ( Peters, 1852 , not True, 1892), auricomis , avarillus , avunculus, calarius, capensis , centralis , drakensbergi, epupae, grahami , klaverensis, lechochloides, lehocla , longicaudatus , monticularis , namibensis, phippsi, siccatus, waterbergensis. COMMENTS: Significance of the appreciable variation in body size and pelage coloration among geographic samples needs to be assessed by systematic revision to determine whether that variation reflects one or more species. Reviewed by Meester et al. (1986) and Skinner and Smithers (1990) .

SYNONYMS: amalae, hintoni, manteufeli , pedester, turneri , vernayi , walambae . COMMENTS: Significance of the morphological variation among samples from different regions needs to be assessed by a systematic revision.
Aethomys silindensis Roberts, 1938 . Ann. Transvaal Mus., 19:245 . TYPE LOCALITY: E Zimbabwe , Mt Silinda . DISTRIBUTION: E Zimbabwe (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:277 ). COMMENTS: For more than 30 years known only by two specimens from the type locality, but samples are now recorded from the nearby Ngorima Reserve in Melsetter Dist. and Stapleford in Umtali Dist, and the species may also occur in adjacent parts of Mozambique ( Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). Particular derived external, cranial, and dental traits phylogenetically tie A. silindensis to the Angolan A. bocagei .
Aethomys nyikae (Thomas, 1897) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1897:431 . TYPE LOCALITY: N Malawi , Nyika Plateau . DISTRIBUTION: N Zambia , Malawi , N Angola , and S Zaire ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: dollmani . COMMENTS: Delany (1975) considered nyikae to be a synonym of kaiseri , but Davis (19756) and Ansell (1978) correctly treated it as a separate species. Ansell (1978) provided documentation for the geographic range and discussed the identity of dollmani . The published record from Eastern Ngorima Reserve in E Zimbabwe is possibly based on a misidentification as inferred by Skinner and Smithers (1990:280) .
Acomys kempi Dollman, 1911 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 8:125 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Chanler Falls, N Guaso Nyiro . DISTRIBUTION: S Somalia , Kenya and NE Tanzania (samples in the Field Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of Natural History); limits unknown. SYNONYMS: montanus , pulchellus. COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Originally described by Dollman as a subspecies of A. ignitus and listed that way by Ellerman (1941) and Hollister (1919) , but considered a subspecies of A. cahirinus by Setzer (1975) . Treated as a species by Janecek et al. (1991) with closest evolutionary ties to A. cahirinus . The morphological characteristics and geographic range of kempi may represent the estern segment of A. cineraceus . Hollister (1919) correctly explained why pulchellus is a synonym of A. kempi ; we include montanus based on our studies.
Acomys cilicicus Spitzenberger, 1978 . Ann. Nat. Hist. Mus. Wien , 81:444 . TYPE LOCALITY: Asiatic Turkey , Vii Mersin , 17 km E Silifke . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Corbet (1984) commented on this species.
Acomys ignitus Dollman, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:229 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Voi . DISTRIBUTION: Usambara Mtns in NE Tanzania (specimens in Field Museum of Natural History), and Kenya ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Petter (1983) recognized ignitus as a valid species, clashing with Setzer (1975) , who regarded it as part of A. dimidiatus . Petter's action reflects reality, reinforcing Hollister (1919) and Ellerman (1941) , who recognized ignitus as a distinct species, but associated the names pulchellus, kempi , and nwntanus with it either as subspecies or direct synonyms. Janecek et al. (1991) considered ignitus distinct and phylogenetically closely related to A. cahirinus , based on genic data.
Acomys cahirinus (Desmarest, 1819) . Nouv. Diet. Hist. Nat., Nouv. ed., 29:70 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Cairo . DISTRIBUTION: W Sahara to Egypt (including Sinai ), N Nigeria , N Ethiopia , N Sudan , Jordan , Israel , Lebanon , Syria , Yemen , Oman , Saudi Arabia , S Iraq , Iran , and Pakistan . SYNONYMS: airensis , albigena, chudeaui , dimidiatus , flavidus , helmyi, hispidus , homericus, hunteri , megalodus, megalotis , nubicus, sabryi , seurati , viator , whitei. COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Synonyms have either been treated as separate species, or as subspecies or synonyms of either A. cahirinus or A. dimidiatus ( Ellerman, 1941 ; Harrison and Bates, 1991 ; Petter, 1983 ; Setzer, 1975 ). The cahirinus-dimidiatus complex needs critical systematic revision and may consist of several morphologically similar species ( Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Petter, 1983 ). Benazzou (1983) , for example, recognized chudeaui as a species, and Le Berre and Le Guelte (1990) listed airensis and chudeaui as separate species. Chromosomal data reported by Tranier (1975, under A. airensis ), Al-Saleh (1988), Volobouev et al. (1991 , under A. dimidiatus ), and Harrison and Bates (1991) .
Acomys cineraceus Fitzinger and Heuglin, 1866 . Sitzb. K. Akad. Wiss. Wien , 54:573 . TYPE LOCALITY: WC Sudan , Doka, E Sennaar ( Allen, 1939:364 ) . DISTRIBUTION: From N Ghana and Burkina Faso through N Togo , N Benin , S Niger, and N Nigeria to C and S Sudan , N Uganda , and C and S Ethiopia (specimens in the National Museum of Natural History). SYNONYMS: cinerascens , hawashensis, hystrella , intermedius , johannis , lowei , witherbyi . COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Dieterlen (in litt.) noted that A. cineraceus is a distinct species and one of four (A. wilsoni , A. percivali , and A. cahirinus ) occurring in Sudan . Petter (1983) recognized witherbyi as a species, and reported that it coexists with a member of the cahirinus-dimidiatus complex in Sudan . In morphology, A. cineraceus is closely similar to A. kempi ; systematic revision would reveal whether each is a species, or simply represents a population of one species.
Acomys russatus (Wagner, 1840) . Abh. Akad. Wiss. Münchin, 3:195 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Sinai . DISTRIBUTION: E Egypt , Sinai , Jordan , Israel , and Saudi Arabia . SYNONYMS: aegyptiacus , affinis , harrisoni , lewisi. COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Qumsiyeh et al. (1986) retained lewisi as a species because although the karyotype of a sample from Jordan was indistinguishable from that of A. russatus , fur color and bacular morphology of lewisi was distinctive ( Atallah, 1967 ). However, based on morphological evidence, lewisi was included in A. russatus by Corbet (1978c) , Osborn and Helmy (1980) , and Harrison and Bates (1991) . This allocation was also supported by genic data ( Janecek et al., 1991 ).
Acomys percivali Dollman, 1911 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 8:126 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Chanler Falls, Nyiro . DISTRIBUTION: S Sudan (E of White Nile ), Uganda , Kenya , Ethiopia , and S Somalia . COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Treated as a synonym of kempi , which in turn was included within A. cahirinus by Setzer (1975) . However, Hollister (1919) treated percivali as a species based on many specimens, as did Ellerman (1941) . Both Matthey (1968) and Hubert (1978b) identified specimens from Ethiopia as A. percivali . Petter (1983) acknowledged the specific status of percivali as did Neal (1983) . Janecek et al. (1991) regarded percivali as the species genically most closely related to A. wilsoni .

Listed as a subspecies of A. dimidiatus by Ellerman (1941) and included in A. cahirinus by Corbet (1978c) , but treated as a distinct species by Spitzenberger (1978).
Acomys mullah Thomas, 1904 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 14:103 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia and Somalia ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: brockmani . COMMENTS: Subgenus Acomys . Petter (1983) recognized brockmani as a valid species, suggesting it might be referable to mullah , which is the older name. These two forms are characterized by large molar rows, also diagnostic of lowei , which Petter implicitly associated with both mullah and brockmani as species. Ellerman (1941) also recognized mullah and brockmani as species, but Setzer (1975) arranged lowei as a subspecies of A. cahirinus, Dieterlen (in litt.) treated it as a synonym of A. cineraceus , and Setzer (1975) treated mullah and brockmani as subspecies of A. dimidiatus . Yalden et al. (1976) listed mullah as a synonym of A. cahirinus .

Bandicota indica (Bechstein, 1800) . In Pennant, Allgemeine Ueber Vierfuss. Thiere, 2:497 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Pondicherry . DISTRIBUTION: Sri Lanka , peninsular India north to Nepal , NE India ( Assam ), Burma , S China ( Yunnan and Hong Kong Isl), Taiwan , Thailand , Laos , and Vietnam . Introduced into Kedah and Perlis regions of Malay Peninsula ( Harrison, 1956 ; J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a) as well as Sumatra and Java ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ). Its spotty distribution may reflect other geographic introductions ( Taiwan for example); "since it is commensal, large, and delicious to eat, this bandicoot may have been spread by man in comparatively recent times" (J. T. Marshall, Jr., 1977a:428). SYNONYMS: bandicota (of Bechstein, 1800; see Ellerman, 1941 ), elliotanus , eloquens , gigantea , jabouillei , kagii, macropus , malabarica , mordax , nemorivaga, perchai, setifera, siamensis , taiwanus. COMMENTS: Morphologically more closely related to B. savilei than to B. bengalensis , but based on gel electrophoretic comparisons closer to Nesokia than to other species of Bandicota ( Radtke and Niethammer, 1984 /85). Chromosomal data for Thai samples provided by Markvong et al. (1973) . A careful systematic revision is necessary to assess the significance of morphological and biochemical variation among samples. Pradhan et al. (1989) , for example, argued that B. gigantea is specifically distinct from B. indica, and indicated they are pursuing a taxonomic revision of the genus.
Bandicota savilei Thomas, 1916 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 24:641 . TYPE LOCALITY: Burma , Mt Popa, about 2500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from E Burma , Thailand , and Vietnam ; probably also occurs in S Laos and Cambodia . SYNONYMS: bangchakensis, curtata , giaraiensis, hichensis. COMMENTS: Occurs sympatrically with B. indica in C and S Thailand and S Vietnam ; found with B. bengalensis in Burma where B. savilei lives in fields and B. bengalensis in village houses. Bandicota savilei is a very distinctive species as Thomas (191 6d) pointed out when he described it; unfortunately it was later incorrectly treated as a subspecies of B. indica ( Ellerman, 1961 ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ). Specimens are usually misidentified as B. bengalensis , but in external, cranial, and dental morphology, B. savilei is linked to B. indica . Electrophoretic data, however, indicated a closer relationship with B. bengalensis than with B. indica ( Radtke and Niethammer, 1984 /85). Chromosomal information reported by Markvong et al. (1973) . Lekagul and Felten (1989) described bangchakensis as a species; hichensis and giaraiensis were proposed as subspecies of B. bengalensis ( Dao, 1961 ; Dao and Cao, 1990 ).
Batomys Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6,16:162 . TYPE SPECIES: Batomys granti Thomas, 1895 . SYNONYMS: Mindanomys. COMMENTS: A Philippine Old Endemic in the same monophyletic group as Crateromys and Carpomys ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ) . An undescribed species is found on Dinagat Isl. Actual distribution in archipelago and number of species in genus yet to be determined.
Bullimus Mearns, 1905 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 28:450 . TYPE SPECIES: Bullimus bagobus Mearns, 1905 . COMMENTS: Although described as a distinctive genus by Mearns, Bullimus has been treated as a subgenus of Rattus in most taxonomic works (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ; Misonne, 1969 ; Simpson, 1945 ) until generically reinstated by Musser (1982c) and Musser and Newcomb (1983) and rediagnosed by Musser and Heaney (1992) , who also documented taxonomic history and past associations with other murine genera. Belongs to the group of Philippine New Endemics, but its closest phylogenetic relative has yet to be resolved ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). Genus needs critical systematic revision, number of actual species is uncertain, those listed below are provisional ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ; Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ).
Batomys granti Thomas, 1895 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 16:162 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , N Luzon Isl, Mountain Prov, Mt Data, 7000 ft .

DISTRIBUTION: Islands of Mindanao, Biliran , and Leyte at low and middle elevations. COMMENTS: Originally described as the only species in Mindanomys by Sanborn (1953), but that genus was considered inseparable from Batomys by Misonne (1969) and Musser and Heaney (1992) . Probably more closely related to B. granti than to B. dentatus .

Berylmys Ellerman, 1947 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 117:261 . TYPE SPECIES: Epimys manipulus Thomas, 1916 . COMMENTS: Originally proposed as a subgenus of Rattus by Ellerman (1947-1948), but elevated to generic rank in a revision by Musser and Newcomb (1983) which recorded taxonomic history of names and groups associated with Berylmys , and reported past evolutionary histories of species (which have been centered in Indochina), finding that Berylmys was dentally similar to Niviventer , Maxomys , and Leopoldamys , but shared some derived cranial characters with Rattus and that phylogenetic relationships were still unknown. Sperm morphology united Berylmys with Sundamys, Rattus, and Leopoldamys ( Breed and Yong, 1986 ), but that union was based on a shared spermatozoal form which is probably primitive.
Arvicanthis niloticus (Desmarest, 1822) . Mammalogie in Encyclop. Méth., 2:281 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt . DISTRIBUTION: Specimens we examined were from S Mauritania , Senegal , and Gambia east through Sierra Leone , Ivory Coast , Ghana , Burkina Faso , Togo , Benin , Nigeria , S Niger, S Chad, Sudan, and Egypt to the western half of Ethiopia (to and in the Rift Valley); south through NE Zaire , Uganda , S Burundi , Kenya and Tanzania west of the Rift Valley, into E Zamibia, where the population is isolated from the nearest one, which is in SW Tanzania ( Ansell, 1978 ); there is a record from N Malawi (1 skull only, living animals never found; Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ); and the species occurs in SW Arabia. SYNONYMS: ansorgei , centralis , centrosus, dembeensis , discolor , jebelae , kordofanensis, luctosus, variegatus var. major , mearnsi , variegatus var. minor , mordax , muansae , naso , nubilans, occidentalis , ochropus , pelliceus , raffertyi, reichardi, rhodesiae, rossii, rubescens , rufinus , setosus , solatus, tenebrosus, testicularis , variegatus , zaphiri . COMMENTS: We include dembeensis , which has been recognized as a distinct species occurring in Ethiopia and nearby regions ( Yalden et al., 1976 ; Demeter, 1983 ). Thomas (1910b) had once associated dembeensis with Desmomys , noting that it had already been referred to Mus , Arvicanthis , Golunda , Pelomys , and Oenomys . Later, however, Thomas (1928a) referred dembeensis to Arvicanthis , a view confirmed by Osgood (1936) and reinforced by Dieterlen (1974). The name lacernatus was once used in place of dembeensis for the Ethiopian samples of Arvicanthis ( Allen, 1939 ; Corbet and Yalden, 1972 ; Osgood, 1936 ) but cranium of the holotype is an example of Meriones ( Yalden et al., 1976 ) . Arvicanthis dembeensis was thought to be a separate species because Ethiopian samples were originally contrasted by Corbet and Yalden (1972 , under the name lacernatus) with abyssinicus, which they treated as a subspecies of A. niloticus. However, abyssinicus is a distinctive species related to A. blicki and not to A. niloticus. We observed that the diagnostic features attributed to dembeensis also described samples of Arvicanthis from throughout Africa west and south of Ethiopia . Sympatry with other species of Arvicanthis has been recorded at several places in Uganda ( Delany, 1975 ; Dollman, 1911 ; Hollister, 1919 ), but we cannot distinguish two kinds at the localities. The only verifiable sympatry is between the large-bodied A. niloticus and the small-bodied A. somalicus in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia (niloticus was recorded as either dembeensis or lacernatus; Corbet and Yalden, 1972 ; Demeter, 1983 ) and in the Mawele region (Mwanasomano's, 30 mi S Tabora ) In C Tanzania (documented by specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard). Allopatry or parapatry, however, is usual. In Ethiopia , A. niloticus occurs up to about 2000 ft and is replaced at higher elevations by A. abyssiniens and A. blicki ( Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ); in Kenya and Tanzania , A. niloticus ranges west of the E Rift Valley and is allopatric with A. nairobae, found in and east of the Rift. Our definition of A. niloticus is unsatisfactory. There is appreciable intra- and interpopulational variation in body size, pelage coloration, and cytological and biochemical traits, and the significance of this variation should be assessed by a critical systematic revision; more than one species may be present in the complex, as suggested by morphometric ( Rousseau, 1983 ), chromosomal ( Viegas-Pequignot et al., 1983 ; Volobouev et al., 1987 ) and electrophoretic ( Kaminski et al., 1984 ) analyses. Furthermore, Corbet (1984) questioned including the Arabian naso with A. niloticus. Capanna and Civitelli (1988) recorded a karyotype with 2N=44 from a sample they identified as A. niloticus from Somalia ; this contrasts with the range of 56-62 usually reported among samples of the species.
Arvicanthis nairobae J. A. Allen, 1909 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 26:168 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Nairobi . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded in and east of the Rift Valley from Mount Lololokwi ("an isolated mountain east of the Mathews Range, about midway between Mount Kenia and Mount Marsabit ," Hollister, 1919 ) in C Kenya south to the Dodoma region in EC Tanzania ; N and S limits unknown. SYNONYMS: chanleri , pallescens, praeceps, virescens. COMMENTS: The name nairobae is the oldest applicable to samples from east of the Rift Valley in Kenya and Tanzania containing animals smaller in body size and gererally brighter and buffier in pelage than those larger and darker specimens we have identified as A. niloticus from west of the Rift. Some specimens of A. nairobae closely resemble those of A. somalicus in pelage coloration, and might be mistaken for it, but are larger in body size. Corbet and Yalden (1972) even suggested that chanleri might represent somalicus , but the holotype is larger and fits within the range of variation seen among samples of nairobae . Records of sympatry between nairobae and somalicus are documented by series from Mount Lololokwi (specimens in the National Museum of Natural History), and the Dodoma region of Tanzania (samples in the American Museum of Natural History), and the two are probably broadly sympatric throughout their ranges in Kenya and Tanzania . The morphological and geographic relationships between A. nairobae and A. niloticus require resolution, which could be accomplished by systematic review of the niloticus-nairobae complex. For example, nairobae is found with A. somalicus in the Dodoma region and they are the only species of Arvicanthis represented by specimens from E Tanzania . In contrast, samples from the Tabora area, to the west of Dodoma , contain A. somalicus and a species significantly larger in body size with darker pelage than samples of A. nairobae from Dodoma . It is this larger species that ranges south into Zambia and north through W Tanzania , W Kenya , and Uganda . Studying the distribution of characters from samples collected along a transect between the Dodoma and Tabora regions would elucidate character and geographic relationships between the two kinds.
Bandicota bengalensis (Gray and Hardwicke, 1833) . Illustr. Indian Zool., pl. 21 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Bengal . DISTRIBUTION: Approximate natural range: Sri Lanka , peninsular India to Pakistan , Kashmir, Nepal , NE India ( Assam ), Bangladesh , and Burma . Introduced to Penang Isl off the W coast of Malay Peninsula ( Chasen, 1936 ), Sumatra and Java ( Musser and Newcomb, 1983 ), and Saudi Arabia (Kock et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: barclayanus , blythianus , daccaensis , dubius , gracilis , insularis , kok , lordi , morungensis , pluritnammis, providens , sindicus , sundavensis, tarayensis , varillus , varius , wardi . COMMENTS: The most morphologically divergent of the species now placed in Bandicota ; so impressive are the differences that bengalensis has been placed in its own genus, Gunomys (see Wroughton, 1908). Geographic variation and one view of subspecies presented by Agrawal and Chakraborty (1976) . Chromosomal data reported by Sharma and Raman (1971 , 1973 ) and Dubey and Raman (1992) . Lekagul and Felten (1989) recognized varius as a distinct species in Thailand , but that record was based on specimens of B. savilei (in Senckenberg Museum).
Arvicanthis somalicus Thomas, 1903 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1902(2):312 [1903]. TYPE LOCALITY: Northern Somaliland ( Somalia ), Shuk, 4000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: N and E Rift Valleys of Ethiopia ( Yalden et al., 1976 ), Somalia , extreme SE Sudan ( Dieterlen and Nikolaus, 1985 ), and south through Kenya in and east of the Rift Valley ( Dollman, 1911 ; Hollister, 1919 ) to C and EC Tanzania on both sides of the Rift; limits have yet to be resolved. SYNONYMS: neumanni , reptans , rumruti. COMMENTS: From the time it was described by Thomas (1903 «), A. somalicus has been treated as a species ( Allen, 1939 ; Dollman, 1911 ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Hollister, 1919 ), and with an exception or two (e.g., Misonne, 1974 ), retains that status ( Rousseau, 1983 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ). Both reliable published records (see above) and specimens we examined document the northern and central range of A. somalicus . Known southern limits of the species are defined by samples from the Mawele region south of Tabora (Mwanasomano's, 31 mi S Tabora ) in C Tanzania and southeast of there at Kilosa in EC Tanzania (specimens in Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard). The species is sympatric with both A. niloticus and A. nairobae (see those accounts). Allen and Loveridge (1933: 117) recorded three specimens from Mwanza on the southern margin of Lake Victoria in Tanzania under the name muansae thinking they represented topotypes of that form, but the holotype of muansae from Mwanza is very large with dark pelage ( Matschie, 1911 ) and is an example of A. niloticus , while their sample is clearly the much smaller and paler A. somalicus ; Mwanza is probably another site of sympatry.
Bandicota Gray, 1873 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 4, 12:418 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus giganteus Hardwicke, 1804 (= Mus indicus Bechstein, 1800 ). SYNONYMS: Gunomys . COMMENTS: Nesokia has been considered the closest relative of Bandicota ( Misonne, 1969 : Niethammer, 1977 ; Radtke and Niethammer, 1984 / 85; Wroughton, 1908), but outside of that alliance, its phylogenetic position among murines is debatable. Misonne (1969) was unsure where to place Bandicota except that it was not related to Rattus ; but Niethammer (1977) and Gemmeke and Niethammer (1984) concluded from morphological, chromosomal, and biochemical data that Rattus is close to Bandicota .
Archboldomys luzonensis Musser, 1982 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 174:30 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , SE Luzon Isl, Camarines Sur Prov, Mt Isarog, 6560 ft .

DISTRIBUTION: Formerly recorded from Negros and Mindanao (Musser, 1982b), but revised view excludes it from Negros, and records it from lowlands of Mindanao, Bohol , Biliran , Dinagat , and Leyte ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). COMMENTS: Included within " Apomys abrae-hylocetes Group " by Musser (1982b).
Apomys insignis Mearns, 1905 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 28:459 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , S Mindanao Isl, Mt Apo, 6000 ft .

Archboldomys Musser, 1982 . Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist., 174:30 . TYPE SPECIES: Archboldomys luzonensis Musser, 1982 . COMMENTS: Member of the Philippine Old Endemics most closely related to Crunomys ; nature of relationship of this monophyletic group formed by Archboldomys and Crunomys to other Philippine shrew rats presently unresolvable ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ).
Arvicanthis blicki Frick, 1914 . Ann. Carnegie Mus., 9:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , South Chilalo Mtns, Hora Mt base camp, 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia ; between 2750 and 3500 m from plateau on E side of Ethiopian Rift Valley ( Yalden et al., 1976 ). COMMENTS: An Ethiopian endemic that is a characteristic diurnal member of Afro-Alpine moorland zone above 3500 m ( Demeter and Topal, 1982 ; Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden, 1988 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ). In morphology, ecological and geographic distributions, and habits, A. blicki is a very distinctive species, as recognized by Dorst (1972) that, judged by similarities in molar topography and dorsal fur patterning, is more closely related to A. abyssinicus than to any other species of Arvicanthis .
Arvicanthis abyssinicus (Riippell, 1842) . Mus. Senckenberg., 3:104 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Simien Prov., Simien Mtns, Entschetqab (see Osgood, 1936:252 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Ethiopia , between 1300-3400 m ( Yalden et al., 1976 ). SYNONYMS: fluvicinctus, rufodorsalis, saturatus . COMMENTS: An Ethiopian endemic and morphologically distinctive species whose closest relative is A. blicki , another Ethiopian endemic. Historically the species was perceived to embrace forms occurring from Ethiopia south to Zambia ( Allen, 1939 ; Dollman, 1911 ; Ellerman, 1941 ), but Osgood (1936:252) discussed several of abyssinicus's diagnostic features, noting that it "is not unlikely that it is confined to Ethiopia and at least some of the forms of Kenya and Uganda which have been associated with it will need other allocation." This view has been reinforced by morphometric analyses ( Rousseau, 1983 ), and our examination of specimens. Arvicanthis abyssinicus and A. blicki are the only species of Arvicanthis endemic to Ethiopia , both are part of middle and high altitude grassland and moorland endemic mammal faunas of Ethiopia ( Demeter and Topal, 1982 ; Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden, 1988 ), and both are more closely related to each other than to any other species of the genus. Arvicanthis niloticus and A. somalicus also occur in Ethiopia (see those accounts), but their ranges also extend far beyond that country's boundaries. Rousseau (1983) regarded mearnsi, described as a subspecies of A. abyssinicus by Frick (1914) , to also be a subspecies of A. abyssinicus, but its qualitative dental and chromatic characteristics fall within the range of variation seen in A. niloticus, as Osgood (1936) and Yalden et al. (1976) noted (discussed by them under either lacernatus or dembeensis). Chromosomal data reported by Orlov et al. (1992) within the context of studying chromosomal variation among Ethiopian samples of Arvicanthis.
Arvicanthis Lesson, 1842 . Nouv. Tabi. Regn. Anim. Mammalifères, p. 147 . TYPE SPECIES: Lemmus niloticus Desmarest, 1822 . SYNONYMS: Isomys . COMMENTS: Opinions on the number of species in the genus have varied from one ( Misonne, 1974 ) to several ( Allen, 1939 ; Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Dollman, 1911 ; Ellerman, 1941 ; Rousseau, 1983 ). The first, and in many ways still most useful, review of Arvicanthis was made by Dollman (1911) . Several recent attempts to assess variability in the genus using breeding studies ( Petter et al., 1969 ), morphometric analyses ( Rousseau, 1983 ), chromosomal evidence ( Capanna and Civitelli, 1988 ; Orlov et al., 1992; Volobouev et al., 1987 ; and references therein), and electrophoretic patterns of blood proteins ( Kaminski et al., 1984 ) have provided partial insights into species-diversity within Arvicanthis , as have results obtained based on examination of museum specimens (focusing on qualitative traits as well as external and craniodental measurements), and study of the discussions by Dollman (1911) , Hollister (1919) , Osgood (1936) , and Corbet and Yalden (1972) . Of the five species we list, three ( abyssinicus , blicki , and somalicus ) are easily diagnosed and recognizable, but two ( niloticus and nairobae ) are not and the geographic ranges and synonyms we provide for each of them are provisional until a sound systematic revision becomes available.
Apodemus sylvaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:62 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sweden, Uppsala. DISTRIBUTION: Europe north to Scandinavia and east to NW Ukraine and N Byelorussia, and on many islands (Iceland, Britain, Ireland, numerous nearby isls, most Mediterranean isls); see map in Niethammer (1978c:341) . Also mountains of N Africa from Atlas Mtns in Morocco east across Algiers to Tunisia (see map in Kock and Felton, 1980). SYNONYMS: albus, algirus, alpinus, bergensis, butei, callipides, candidus, celticus, chamaeropsis clanceyi, creticus, cumbrae, dichruroides, dichrurus, eivissensis, fiolagan, flaviventris, flavobrunneus, fridariensis, frumentariae, ghia, grandiculus, granti, hamiltoni, hayi, hebridensis, hermani, hessei, hirtensis, iconicus, ifranensis, ilvanus, intermedius, isabellinus, islandicus, kilikiae, krkensis, larus, leucocephalus, maclean, maximus, milleri, nesiticus, niger, parvus (Bechstein, 1793, not Argyropulo, 1941), pecchioli, rufescens, spadix, stankovici, tauricus, thuleo, tirae, turai, varius. COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus. The geographic range as outlined here is primarily European and N African. Its occurrence as mapped by Corbet (1978c) east of Byelorussia and W Ukraine reflects ranges of other species (uralensis, fulvipectus, arianus, wardi, rusiges) once included within A. sylvaticus. Contrary to published records, A. sylvaticus is not part of the modern Israeli fauna ( Filippucci et al., 1989 ), but is represented there by fossils from between 40,000 and 10,000 B.C. ( Tchernov, 1979 ). The Arabian Peninsula record at Qatar is based on Mus ( Kock and Nader, 1990 ). Biochemical ( Byrne et al., 1990 ; Fernandes et al., 1991 ; Gemmeke, 1981) and morphometric (Alcantara, 1991; Murback, 1979) intrapopulational analyses provided results of differentiation within species and change in its evolutionary history (see Berry, 1973 , and references therein), as well as insular gigantism ( Libois and Fons, 1990 ). Morphometric contrasts between A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis in context of evolutionary divergence reported by Hedges (1969) , Mezhzherin and Lashkova (1992) and Van der Straeten and Van der Straeten-Harrie (1977) ; chromosomal and biochemical (mtDNA) contrasts by Debrot and Mermod (1977) , Hirning et al. (1989) and Tegelstrom and Jaarola (1989) . European populations (virtually entire species) reviewed by Niethammer (1978c) . North African populations reviewed by Kock and Felten (1980) and Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska (1991) ; the latter also point out that algirus Pomel, 1856 and chamaeropsis Loche, 1867 may refer to species of Mus or Gerbillus . Conspecificity of krkensis with A. sylvaticus was documented by Williams et al. (1980) and Dolan and Yates (1981) .
Apodemus semotus Thomas, 1908 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 1:44 TYPE LOCALITY: Taiwan . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Taiwan . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alsomys . Closely related in morphology to mainland A. draco ( Corbet, 1978c ) .
Apodemus speciosus (Temminck, 1844) . In Siebold, Temminck and Schlegel, Fauna Japonica, Arnz et Socii, Lugduni Batavorum, p. 52 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to four primary islands and smaller islands of Japan (see map in Tsuchiya, 1974 ). SYNONYMS: ainu, dorsalis , insperatus , miyakensis, navigator, sadoensis, tusimaensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Alsomys . Sympatric with A. peninsulae on Hokkaido . The citation is usually cited as 1845, but was published in 1844; see Holthuis and Sakai (1970) . Some of the names (ainu, navigator, and miyakensis) have been listed as species (Vorontsov et al., 1977«; also discussion in Corbet, 1978c ), but we follow Corbet (1978c) in recognizing only one species. This action was also reflected by Tsuchiya (1974) , as he divided the names into two groups of A. speciosus based on biochemical and chromosomal evidence. Saitoh et al. (1989) provided additional biochemical information in context of systematic comparisons among Japanese Apodemus . Placed in subgenus Apodemus by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) and Mezhzherin and Zykov (1991) .
Apodemus rusiges Miller, 1913 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 26:81 . TYPE LOCALITY: N India , C Kashmir . DISTRIBUTION: N India (Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh , and Kumaun); range limits unresolved. SYNONYMS: griseus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . Miller's rusiges was a renaming of True's griseus (see Ellerman, 1941:100 ). Listed as a subspecies of A. flavicollis by Ellerman (1941 , 1961 ) and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , and as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus by Corbet (1978c) , the long-tailed and distinctively patterned rusiges appears to be a separate species endemic to N India .
Apomys Mearns, 1905 . Proc. U.S. Natl. Mus., 28:455 . TYPE SPECIES: Apomys hylocoetes Mearns, 1905 . COMMENTS: At one time included in Rattus , but is a distinct genus and forms a monophyletic group of its own within the assemblage of Philippine Old Endemics ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ). Taxonomic history of the genus and preliminary systematic revision provided by Musser (19826); additional taxonomic notes and phylogenetic relationships outlined by Musser and Heaney (1992) . Undescribed species recorded from Negros and Sibuyan islands ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ); actual distribution in archipelago and number of species still unknown.
Apodemus uralensis (Pallas, 1811) . Zoogr. Rosso-Asiat., 1:168 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , S Ural Mts . DISTRIBUTION: From E Europe and Turkey (see map in Steiner, 1978 , under A. microps ) east to the Altai Mts and NW China ( Xinjiang ), south into the Caucasus; S and E limits unknown. SYNONYMS: baessleri, balchaschensis, charkovensis, ciscaucasicus , microps , microtis , mosquensis, nankiangensis, pallidus , pallipes , tokmak , tscherga , vohlynensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . Listed as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , who also noted that Kuznetzov (in Bobrinskii et al., 1944 ) had already suspected that the Altai tscherga and uralensis refered to the same species. This identity, including those of most of the synonyms, is documented by biochemical and morphological results ( Mezhzherin and Mikhailenko, 1991 ; Mezhzherin and Zykov, 1991 ). Gemmeke (1983) and Vorontsov et al. (1989 , 1992) also provided chromosomal and biochemical information (under microps ), and Tvrtkovic and Dzukic (1977) provided morphological data in context of distinguishing species of Apodemus . Ma et al. (1987) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) treated tscherga as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus, but Corbet (1978c) listed it under A. peninsulae. The NW Chinese nankiangensis was described as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus (see Corbet, 1984 ; Ma et al., 1987 ); we provisionally include it and three of the other synonyms (pallidus, balchaschensis, and pallipes) pending a systematic revision of E Russian, Middle Eastern, and W Chinese Apodemus. E European populations reviewed by Steiner (1978 , under microps).
Apodemus wardi (Wroughton, 1908) . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 18:282 . TYPE LOCALITY: N India , Kashmir, Ladakh, Saspul . DISTRIBUTION: NC Nepal ( Martens and Niethammer, 1972 ) through Kashmir, N Pakistan , and Afghanistan ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ) to NW Iran ; limits unknown. SYNONYMS: bushengensis, pentax. COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvaemus . Originally described as a subspecies of sylvaticus , then listed as a subspecies of A. flavicollis by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , arranged as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus by Corbet (1978c) , and suspected to be a different species than the latter by Gemmeke and Niethammer (1982) based on biochemical analyses of Nepalese and Iranian samples (which were documented by Darviche et al, 1979 ). The form bushengensis from SW Xizang ( Tibet ) was described as a subspecies of A. sylvaticus ( Feng et al., 1986 ) , and we allocate it to wardi pending a revision of the W Chinese, N Indian, and E Russian Apodemus . The relationship between this species, A. peninsulae , A. uralensis , and European A. sylvaticus requires better definition. Marshall (in press) identifies the holotype of sublimis Blanford, 1879 , from Ladakh, as an example of wardi ; if correct, sublimis may be the oldest name for this entity.
Meriones arimalius Cheesman and Hinton, 1924 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 14:554 . TYPE LOCALITY: Saudi Arabia , Yabrin (Jabrin), Djebel Agoula . DISTRIBUTION: "Northern sands of the Rub al Khali in Saudia Arabia and Oman " ( Harrison and Bates, 1991:297 ). COMMENTS: Subgenus Pallasiomys . Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) listed this form as a valid species, but it was later included in M. libycus ( Corbet, 1978c ; Harrison and Bates, 1991 ). Pavlinov et al. (1990:294) reinstated arimalius as a separate species and reviewed its salient characters. Even from the terse description of its diagnostic traits provided by Harrison and Bates (1991:297) , who recognized the form as a subspecies of M. libycus , it is evident that arimalius is quite morphologically different from populations of lybicus north of it in Saudia Arabia. The species was also considered distinct by Nadler and Lay (1967) .
Gerbillus stigmonyx Heuglin, 1877 . Reise in Nordost-Afrika, 2:78 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Khartoum . DISTRIBUTION: Sudan . SYNONYMS: luteolus . COMMENTS: Listed as a synonym of G. campestris by Petter (1975b) ; retained as separate by Lay (1983) .
Gerbillus somalicus (Thomas, 1910) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 5:197 . TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia , Upper Sheikh . DISTRIBUTION: Somalia . COMMENTS: Tentatively regarded as valid following Lay (1983) .
Gerbillus tarabuli Thomas, 1902 . Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1902:5 . TYPE LOCALITY: Libya , Sebha . DISTRIBUTION: Libya . SYNONYMS: hamadensis. COMMENTS: Usually listed as a synonym of G. pyramidutn, G. tarabuli can be distinguished by morphological traits (Lay et al., 1975). Future inquiry, according to Lay (1983:347) "should examine the possibility that the 2N = 40...forms reported from Tunisia , Algeria , Morocco and Senegal ...are conspecific and may be referable to G. tarabuli ."
Gerbillus syrticus Misonne, 1974 . Bull. Inst. R. Sci. Nat. Belg., 50:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: Libya , 12 km N Nofilia . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Relationships obscure (see Lay, 1983 ).
Gerbillus watersi de Winton, 1901 . Novit. Zool., 8:399 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Upper Nile, Shendi . DISTRIBUTION: Somalia , Sudan . COMMENTS: Listed both as a subspecies of G. nanus or as a valid species by Petter (1975b) in the same report. The species should be considered distinct until revisionary studies advise otherwise ( Lay, 1983 ).
Gerbillus vivax (Thomas, 1902) . Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1902:8 . TYPE LOCALITY: Libya , Sebha . DISTRIBUTION: Libya . COMMENTS: Variously placed in either G. dasyurus , G. amoenus , or G. nanus , but Lay (1983) disputed its association with G. dasyurus and urged that its level of relationship to G. amoenus and G. nanus be assessed by systematic revision.
Meriones Illiger, 1811 . Prodr. Syst. Mamm. Avium., p. 82 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus tamariscinus Pallas, 1773 . SYNONYMS: Cheliones , Idomeneus , Meraeus , Pallasiomys , Parameriones . COMMENTS: A member of the tribe Rhombomyini in the scheme of Pavlinov et al. (1990) . No modern systematic revision is available for Meriones . The early revision by Chaworth-Musters and Ellerman (1947) , as updated and modified by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c) , represents the most current review of species in the genus. Additional taxonomic, distributional, and evolutionary views are found in the taxonomic reports and regional faunal studies cited throughout the accounts below. Most workers agree on definitions of the species we list here, but results of careful systematic revision will probably uncover a greater number of species. All chromosomal data concerning Meriones up to 1967 was summarized by Nadler and Lay (1967) in the context of assessing relationships among the species. Additional chromosomal data and its significance to understanding phylogenetic relationships among four species of Meriones reported by Benazzou et al. (1982). Lay and Nadler (1969) summarized laboratory hybridization attempts among several species of Meriones . Records of species from Iran and Pakistan reported by Lay et al. (1970) .

COMMENTS: Subgenus Pallasiomys . Reviewed by Corbet (1978c) . Regional studies cover populations in Algeria ( Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska, 1991 ), Libya ( Ranck, 1968 , as caudatus ), Egypt ( Osborn and Helmy, 1980 ), Arabian Penninsula ( Harrison and Bates, 1991 ), Iran ( Lay, 1967 ), and Afghanistan ( Hassinger, 1973 ). Results of comparative craniometric analyses between Moroccan samples of M. libycus and M. shawi obtained in sympatry were reported by Zaime and Pascal (1988) . Morphological and karyotypic contrasts between these same two species as well as laboratory hybridization experiments, were recorded by Lay and Nadler (1969) . In North Africa, M. libycus inhabits the Sahara desert, but does extend to the Mediterranean in Morocco , Algeria , and Libya where it overlaps the distribution of M. shawi , which is primarily Mediterranean littoral ( Lay and Nadler, 1969 ; Zaime and Pascal, 1988 ). Citations for synonyms among Russian samples were supplied by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) ; afghanus is proposed as a new subspecies in that checklist. The Xinjiang population was reviewed by Ma et al. (1987) . Lay and Nadler (1969) also clarified why caudatus , used by Ranck (1968) as a species name for Libyan samples, simply refers to M. libycus . Corbet (1978c:127) , apparently unaware of the report by Lay and Nadler (1969) , followed Ranck and listed caudatus as a species, but cautioned that caudatus may be "conspecific with M. libycus and that the Libyan forms assigned by Ranck to M. libycus should really be allocated to M. shawi ." This is correct and restates the past confusion that has "clouded the taxonomy of M. shawi and M. libycus because of uncertainty concerning the number of species in this complex and their nomenclature" ( Lay and Nadler, 1969:44 ).

Wang (1964) considered this species, based on a series of adult and immature specimens, to be most closely related to M. meridianus , which also occurs in Xinjiang Prov ( Ma et al., 1987 ). The relationship of chengi to the latter species needs to be assessed by revision of Meriones , especially the M. meridianus complex.

COMMENTS: Most workers have included this taxon in G. nanus (e.g., Kowalski and RzebikKowalska, 1991), but never with supporting evidence, and Lay elaborated why it should be considered valid pending revision of the G. nanus group. The species (listed under G. nanus ) was reviewed by Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska (1991) .
Gerbillus gerbillus (Olivier, 1801) . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, 2:121 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Giza Prov . DISTRIBUTION: From Israel through Egypt and N Sudan to Morocco ; also N Mali , N Niger, and N Chad (see Corbet, 1978c ; Harrison and Bates, 1991:283 ; Osborn and Helmy, 1980:131 ). SYNONYMS: aegyptius , aeruginosus, asyutensis, discolor , foleyi , hirtipes , longicaudatus , psamnwphilous, sudanensis. COMMENTS: Geographic portions reviewed by Ranck (1968) , Corbet (1978c) , Lay (1983) , Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska (1991) , and Harrison and Bates (1991) . In 1983, Lay drew attention to the lack of inquiry into variation in this species which has such an extensive range; that complaint stands today and the species needs careful taxonomic review. The form hirtipes was synonymized with G. gerbillus by Cockrum (1976), but because of his inadequate documentation, Lay (1983) was reluctant to accept this union. Cockrum's evidence was scanty, but we are swayed by Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska's (1991) argument for merging hirtipes with G. gerbillus . The origin of multiple sex chromosomes in this species was discussed by Wahrman et al. (1983) .

DISTRIBUTION: E desert of S Egypt (see Osborn and Helmy, 1980 ) and probably adjacent Sudan . COMMENTS: Although some authors have placed this species with G. nanus (see references in Lay, 1983 ), Osborn and Helmy (1980) demonstrated its specific distinction.
Gerbillus lowei (Thomas and Hinton, 1923) . Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1923:261 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Jebel Marra . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Synonymized with G. campestris by Petter (1975b) without supporting evidence, but should be kept separate pending revision of the genus ( Lay, 1983 ).
Gerbillus latastei Thomas and Trouessart, 1903 . Bull. Soc. Zool. France , 28:172 . TYPE LOCALITY: Tunisia , Kebili . DISTRIBUTION: Tunisia and Libya . SYNONYMS: aureus , favillus, nalutensis. COMMENTS: The three synonyms listed here along with bonhotei , dunni , perpallidus , riggenbachi , and rosalinda were united with G. latastei by Cockrum (1977) when he reported on the specific identity of that species. Lay (1983) discussed the basis for considering each of these five as separate species. The Libyan populations (under G. aureus ) were reviewed by Ranck (1968) .
Gerbillus juliani (St. Leger, 1935) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 10, 15:669 . TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia , Bulhar . DISTRIBUTION: Somalia . COMMENTS: Roche and Petter (1968) reviewed this species under Monodia , but Petter (1975b) later synonymized it with G. watersi without supporting evidence. Lay (1983) recognized juliani as valid pending revision of the genus.
Gerbillus henleyi (de Winton, 1903) . Novit. Zool., 10:284 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Wadi Natron, Zaghig . DISTRIBUTION: From Algeria through N Africa to Israel and Jordan , scattered records in W Saudia Arabia, N Yemen , and Oman ; also recorded from Burkina Faso ( Maddalena et al., 1988 ) and N Senegal ( Duplantier et al. 1991a ). SYNONYMS: jordani , makrami , marine. COMMENTS: Broad segments of the species reviewed by Ranck (1968 , Libya ), Osborn and Helmy (1980 , Egypt ), Harrison and Bates (1991 , Arabian Peninsula), and Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska (1991 , Algeria ). The occurrences in Burkina Faso and Senegal were postulated to reflect the southward expansion of Saharan environments ( Duplantier et al., 1991a ).
Gerbillus amoenus (de Winton, 1902) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:46 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Giza Prov . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Egypt and Libya . COMMENTS: Lay (1983) speculated that the species may range across Tunisia and Algeria to Mauritania , noted its past associations with dasyurus and campestris , and advised future comparison with G. nanus . Ranck (1968) reviewed the Libyan populations and recorded significant geographic variation.
Gerbillus burloni F. Cuvier, 1838 . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 2: 145 , pl. 25. TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Dharfur . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Usually treated as a synonym of G. pyramidum , but Lay (1983) mustered diagnostic cranial traits that appear to distinguish them.
Gerbillus brockmani (Thomas, 1910) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 5:420 . TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia , Burao, 85 mi S Berbera . DISTRIBUTION: Somalia . COMMENTS: Petter (1975b) placed brockmani in synonymy with G. nanus , but no evidence indicates that the species occurs anywhere remotely near Somalia (see Lay, 1983 ).
Gerbillus andersoni de Winton, 1902 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 9:45 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , E Alexandria , Mandara . DISTRIBUTION: Egypt , Nile Delta south to El Faiyum (as mapped for G. a. andersoni by Osborn and Helmy, 1980:120 ). COMMENTS: The forms allenbyi , inflatus , and bonhotei have all been listed as synonyms of G. andersoni (e.g., Harrison and Bates, 1991 ; Osborn and Helmy, 1980 ), but Lay (1983) argued that current evidence does not support the union of these forms. He also suggested that bland and eatoni be tentatively associated with G. andersoni . The latter species should be considered monotypic pending a revision. With the range as described above, G. andersoni is allopatric with G. eatoni to the west and G. bonhotei to the east (see those accounts).
Gerbillus allenbyi Thomas, 1918 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 2:146 . TYPE LOCALITY: Israel , Rehoboth . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Israel , coastal dunes from N of Gaza to Haifa . COMMENTS: Lay (1983) mentioned the synonymy of this form with G. andersoni , as accepted by Harrison and Bates (1991) , but kept it separate pending a revision of the genus.
Gerbillus bilensis Frick, 1914 . Ann. Carnegie Mus., 9:12 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , near Bilen . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Lay (1983) questioned the synonymy of this species with pulvinatus as allocated by Petter (1975b) .
Gerbillus bonhotei Thomas, 1919 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 3:560 . TYPE LOCALITY: Egypt , Sinai , Khubra Abu Guzoar . DISTRIBUTION: NE Sinai Peninsula . COMMENTS: Usually included in G. andersoni ( Harrison and Bates, 1991 ; Osborn and Helmy, 1980 ) but maintained as distinct pending systematic review of the genus ( Lay, 1983 ). Harrison and Bates (1991) recorded the form from Jordan , an occurrence which requires corroboration according to Lay (1983) .
Gerbillus aquilus Schütter and Setzer, 1972 . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 86:167 . TYPE LOCALITY: Iran , 60 km W Kerman . DISTRIBUTION: SE Iran , W Pakistan , S Afghanistan (see Lay and Nadler, 1975 ). SYNONYMS: subsolanus. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Lay and Nadler (1975) .
Gerbillus bottai Lataste, 1882 . Le Naturaliste, 4:36 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Sennar . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Sudan and Kenya . COMMENTS: Although luteolus and harwoodi have been included in bottai, Lay (1983) related reasons, based on presence or absence of accessory tympanum, for provisionally regarding the species as monotypic.
Gerbillus dasyurus (Wagner, 1842) . Arch. Naturgesch., 8:20 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sinai . DISTRIBUTION: Arabian Peninsula, Iraq , Syria , Lebanon , Israel , Sinai (see Harrison and Bates, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: dasyroides , gallagheri, leosollicitus, palmyrae. COMMENTS: Review of morphology and distribution, along with citations for synonyms, provided by Harrison and Bates (1991) . Those authors also listed lixa as a synonym of G. dasyurus , but the holotype , a young animal, has an accessory tympanum and bare soled hind feet, which is uncharacteristic of G. dasyurus but does suggest alliance with G. nanus ( Lay, 1983 ) .
Gerbillus dalloni Heim de Balsac, 1936 . Mem. Acad. Sci. de l'lnst. de France , ser. 2, 62:43 (Mem. no. 1), text F. 1. TYPE LOCALITY: Chad , Tibesti region . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Another species united with G. agag by Petter (1975b) without supporting documentation, "but the type localities are separated by more than 2300 km " ( Lay, 1983:340 ), and should "be regarded as a valid species pending revision."
Gerbillus cosensis Dollman, 1914 . Abstr. Proc.Zool.Soc.London,1914(131):25 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Kozibiri River, Ngamatak,TurkwelRiver . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the typelocality. COMMENTS: Petter (1975b) synonymized thisform withG. agag , butLay(1983)regardedit as separate pending revision.
Gerbillus diminutus (Dollmann, 1911) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 7:520 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Nyama Nyango, Guaso Nyiro . DISTRIBUTION: Kenya . COMMENTS: United with G. pusillus by Petter (1975b) without substantiation; should be kept separate until its status can be clarified by systematic revision ( Lay, 1983 ).
Gerbillus dongolanus (Heuglin, 1877) . Reise in Nordost-Afrika, 2:79 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , Dongola . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Lay (1983) noted that several authors have synonymized this taxon with G. pyramidum but always without confirmatory documentation. Until that data is available, the species should be considered valid.
Gerbillus campestris (Loche, 1867) . Expl. Sci. Alg. Zool. Mamm., p. 106 . TYPE LOCALITY: Algeria , Constantine Prov. , Philipeville . DISTRIBUTION: N Africa, from Morocco to Egypt and Sudan . SYNONYMS: brunnescens, cinnamomeus , dodsoni , haymani, patrizii, riparius , rozsikae, somalicus , venustus , wassifi. COMMENTS: Nineteen species-group names have been associated with G. campestris by different authors in various combinations, as summarized by Lay (1983) . He also noted that most opinions lacked supportive evidence and that some of the synonyms are unidentifiable or nomina nuda. Those names listed here are probably correctly associated with G. campestris , but the species requires refined definition through careful systematic revision. Different geographical populations are reviewed by Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska (1991 , Algeria ), Ranck (1968 , Libya ), and Osborn and Helmy (1980 , Egypt ). Benazzou and Zyadi (1990) conducted a biometric study analyzing variation among Moroccan populations. Cockrum and Setzer (1976:643) clarified the author and date of publication of campestris .
Gerbillus cheesmani Thomas, 1919 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 26:748 . TYPE LOCALITY: Iraq , Lower Euphrates, near Basra . DISTRIBUTION: SW Iran , C and S Iraq , Saudi Arabia , Oman , North Yemen , South Yemen , and Kuwait (see Lay and Nadler, 1975 ; Harrison and Bates, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: arduus , maritimus . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Lay and Nadler (1975) , Lay (1983) , and Harrison and Bates (1991) . Chromosomal polymorphism among samples from Kuwait was analyzed and reported by Badr and Asker (1980) . Detailed comparisons between Qatarian G. cheesmani and G. nanus in cranial morphology were reported by Madkour (1984) .
Lophiomys imhausi Milne-Edwards, 1867 . LTnstitut, Paris, 35:46 . TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia ("Probably from African coast opposite Aden, where it was purchased," Allen, 1939:315 ; also see Thomas, 1910c:222 ) . DISTRIBUTION: E Sudan , Ethiopia , Somalia , Kenya , Uganda , and Tanzania ; from sea level up to 3300 m in Ethiopia ( Yalden et al., 1976 ), but apparently restricted to mountain forest in Kenya and Uganda ( Hollister, 1919 ; Delany, 1975 ). Known from Israel by subfossils and may occur in Arabia ( Harrison and Bates, 1991 ). SYNONYMS: aethiopicus, bozasi , hindei , ibeanus , smithi , testudo, thomasi . COMMENTS: Thomas (1910c) recognized four species of Lophiomys , but Ellerman (1940:636) noted that "Thomas evidently came to the conclusion that all the East African 'species' were one, as there is a note in his tracts to this effect. I am inclined to go further and think that until more material comes to hand all forms must be treated as races of the earliest name imhausi ." Ellerman's view prevails today and has yet to be tested by careful taxonomic revision.
Taterillus petteri Gautun, Tranier, and Sicard, 1985 . Mammalia, 49:538 . TYPE LOCALITY: Burkina Faso ( Upper Volta ), Oudalan Prov., near Oursi Pond; 14°38'N , 00°26'W (as refined by Sicard et al., 1988:188 ) .

COMMENTS: As explained by Ansell (1989a) , the availability of petteri should properly date from its first checklist citation ( Gautun et al., 1985 ), not from its later formal description ( Sicard et al., 1988 ). According to Sicard et al. (1988) , T. petteri is confined to the loop of the Niger River and is parapatric with T. gracilis , from which it differs in morphology, ecology, biochemistry, and physiology. In the same paper, they stated that petteri may actually be conspecific with angelus (from Gambia ), although they acknowledged not examining the holotype of the latter, and they speculated that angelus and lacustris may prove to be the same, but, because the type of the former is young and that of the latter is old, the relationship is difficult to demonstrate. The contribution of petteri to the systematic literature of African gerbils hardly improves the picture of relationships among populations of Taterillus .
Taterillus lacustris (Thomas and Wroughton, 1907) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 19:37 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nigeria , Lake Chad (= Kaddai) . DISTRIBUTION: NE Nigeria and Cameroon . COMMENTS: Rosevear (1969) synonymized this with T. gracilis , but both Robbins (1974 , 1977 ) and Petter (1975b) treated it as a distinct species.
Taterillus harringtoni (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 18:303 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , east of Lake Turkana (Rudolf), near Mutti Galeb . DISTRIBUTION: Central African Republic , Sudan , Ethiopia , Somalia , E Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania . SYNONYMS: illustris, kadugliensis, lorenzi, lowei , melanops , meneghetti, nubilus, osgoodi , perluteus, rufus , tenebricus , zammarani. COMMENTS: Allocation of synonyms to this species follows Robbins (1977) .
Taterillus pygargus (F. Cuvier, 1838) . Trans. Zool. Soc. London, 2:142 . TYPE LOCALITY: Senegal , probably St. Louis (as suggested by Robbins, 1977:191 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Gambia , Senegal , S Mauritania , and W Mali . COMMENTS: Cuvier's pygargus was included in Gerbillus pyramidum , but the holotype is an example of Taterillus ( Petter et al., 1972 ; Petter, 1975b , and references therein). Apparently unaware of Petter's observation, Lay (1983) listed pygargus as a species of Gerbillus known only from the type locality, which he thought was Egypt .
Lophiomys Milne-Edwards, 1867 . L'Institut, Paris, 35:46 . TYPE SPECIES: Lophiomys imhausii Milne-Edwards, 1867 . SYNONYMS: Phractomys , Phragmomys . COMMENTS: Closest relatives are Microlophiomys vorontsovi from late Miocene of Ukraine (Topacevski and Skorik, 1984), and Cricetops dormitor from middle Oligocene of Mongolia and Kazakhstan ( Wahlert, 1984 ).
Subfamily Lophiomyinae Milne-Edwards, 1867 . Arch. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris. Mémoires C, III, p. 81 -116. COMMENTS: See Carleton and Musser (1984) for diagnosis and general characterisitics, as well as other discussion. They also summarized past estimates of relationships, which were generally reflected in arrangement of Lophiomys in its own family or in a subfamily of either Cricetidae or Nesomyidae . Wahlert (1984) allocated Lophiomys and Cricetops to Lophiomyinae and considered this cluster closely related to Cricetinae .
Abditomys latidens (Sanborn, 1952) . Fieldiana Zool., 33:125 . TYPE LOCALITY: Philippines , Luzon Isl, Mountain Prov, Mt Data, 7500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only by two specimens from Luzon. COMMENTS: Taxonomic, morphological, and ecological data provided by Musser (1982a). Shown by Musser and Heaney (1992) to be close phylogenetic relative of Tryphomys adustus , another Luzon endemic.
Subfamily Murinae Illiger, 1815 . Abh. Phys. Klasse K.-Preuss Akad. Wiss. Berlin , for 1804-11, p. 46,129 [1815]. SYNONYMS: Anisomyini , Conilurinae, Hydromyinae, Murina , Phloeomyinae , Pseudomyinae , Rhynchomyinae . COMMENTS: Diagnosis, characteristics, and contents of subfamily generally as presented by Carleton and Musser (1984) . No general tribal arrangement of genera is available except for provincial groupings (Conilurini and Hydromyini for Australian species [summarized in Watts and Aslin, 1981 ] and Anisomyini for some New Guinea genera [ Lidicker and Brylski, 1987 ]). Acomys and Uranomys would be excluded from the subfamily by some (see those accounts). Comparative chromosomal data provided in phylogenetic framework and other contexts for European species by Zima and Kràl (1984a) , for some Asian groups by Markvong et al. (1973) , Raman and Sharma (1977) , Gadi and Sharma (1983) , and Cao and Tran (1984) , for African species by Robbins and Baker (1978) , for Australian forms by Baverstock et al. (1977c-e, 1983a, b), for New Guinea species by Donnellan (1987) , and for murines in general by ViegasPequignot et al. (1983, 1985, 1986). Phylogenetic relationships among Australian species based on biochemical results reported by Baverstock et al. (1977 a, b, 1980 ) and Watts et al. (1992) , those among other species reported by Iskandar and Bonhomme (1984) and Bonhomme et al. (1985) . DNA-DNA hybridization results reported in phylogenetic context by Catzeflis (1990) and Catzeflis et al. (1987) . Amplification of DNA (LI) in relationship to murine divergence from other muroids reported by Pascale et al. (1990) . Comparative data on hair morphology ( Keogh, 1985 ), soft palate topography ( Eisentraut, 1969a ; Foiling, 1992), and digestive system anatomy ( Perrin and Curtis, 1980 ) provided results for phylogenetic analyses. The discrepency between the relativley rapid divergence of murine taxa as revealed by fossils and the much slower rates indicated by molecular data is reconciled by Jaeger et al. (1986) by postulating accelerated rates of evolution for certain proteins and a higher rate of nucleotide substitution in murines than ordinarily seen in other eutherians.
Abditomys Musser, 1982 . Am. Mus. Novit., 2730:3 . TYPE SPECIES: Rattus latidens Sanborn, 1952 . COMMENTS: Belongs to the Philippine New Endemic cluster ( Musser and Heaney, 1992 ).
Acomys I. Geoffroy, 1838 . Ann. Sci. Nat. Zool. (Paris), ser. 2, 10: 126 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus cahirinus Desmarest, 1819 . SYNONYMS: Acanthomys, Peracomys . COMMENTS: Except for a brief list of species and subspecies made by Setzer (1975) , the partial reviews by Matthey (1965a , b, 1968) based on chromosomal data, by Petter (1983) using morphology, by Janecek et al. (1991) that incorporated genic data, and the regional systematic revision by Dippenaar and Rautenbach (1986) , no systematic revision of Acomys is available. Even the inclusion of Acomys within Murinae is questioned. Morphological evidence has been used to support a close relationship to Mus (see Jacobs, 1978 ) and Uranomys (see Hinton, 1921 ; Misonne, 1969 ), but reproductive biology of Acomys is special among murines ( Dieterlen, 1961 , 1962 , 1963 ), and biochemical data suggested Acomys is not closely related to Mus but to Uranomys , and is either distantly related to murines or not even a member of the subfamily ( Bonhomme et al., 1985 ; Pascale et al., 1990 ; Sarich, 1985 ; Wilson et al., 1987 ). Dental evidence links Acomys, Uranomys, and Lophuromys to the exclusion of all other extant African muroids (Denys and Michaux, 1992). According to Denys (1990), Acomys is at least 4.5 million years old and not recently evolved, and careful comparisons between Acomys and primitive murines as well as muroids in general are necessary to determine phylogenetic position of genus. Extant species are sorted into two subgenera (Acomys and Peracomys), but these groupings require reassesment by systematic revision of genus. Chromosomal data were summarized by Volobouev et al. (1991) and Sokolov et al. (1992).
Tatera phillipsi (de Winton, 1898) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 1:253 . TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia , Hanka Dadi . DISTRIBUTION: Somalia and the Rift Valley in Ethiopia and Kenya (see Bates, 1988 ). SYNONYMS: bodessana, umbrosa. COMMENTS: Subgenus Taterona . Revised by Bates (1988) . The form minusculus is most probably synonymous with either T. phillipsi or T. robusta ( Bates, 1988 ) .

DISTRIBUTION: An extensive range from Syria , Iraq , and Kuwait through Iran , Afghanistan , and Pakistan into most of Indian Peninsula north to the Terai region of S Nepal ; also Sri Lanka (see Bates, 1988 ). SYNONYMS: bailwardi , ceylonica , cuvieri , dunni , hardwickei , monticola , otarius , persica , pitmani , scansa, sherrini , taeniurus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Tatera . Revised by Bates (1988) , who recognized three distinctive subspecies. Regional reviews of the species include the segments from Arabian Peninsula ( Harrison and Bates, 1991 ), Iran ( Lay, 1967 ), Afghanistan ( Hassinger, 1973 ), and Pakistan ( Roberts, 1977 ). This is the only species that Pavlinov et al. (1990) allocated to the genus Tatera , redefining all African species to the genus Gerbilliscus .
Tatera kempi Wroughton, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:375 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nigeria , Aguleri . DISTRIBUTION: Senegal and Guinea (Mt Nimba) to Cameroon . SYNONYMS: gambiana , giffardi , hopkinsoni , welmanni. COMMENTS: Bates (1988) listed kempi as a synonym of T. valida . With the exception of Nigeria , no specimens were examined from the range of T. kempi (including the forms synonymized here). Davis (1975a) also recognized kempi as a subspecies of T. valida , including the same synonyms listed below. Although Rosevear (1969) recognized kempi , hopkinsoni , and welmanni as separate species within West Africa, he commented that hopkinsoni and welmanni were probably only racially distinct. We separate T. kempi from T. valida and provisionally treat hopkinsoni and welmanni as synonyms, pending a critical revision. Chromosomal data were reported from samples collected in Burkina Faso ( Gautun et al., 1985 , as hopkinsoni ) and Mt Nimba in Guinea ( Gautun et al., 1986 , as either kempi or hopkinsoni ).

SYNONYMS: angelus, nigeriae . COMMENTS: Chromosomal data were reported by Gautun et al. (1985) for the sample from Burkina Faso . Rosevear (1969) included angelus in this species, but Sicard et al. (1988) discussed its possible specific status. The form nigeriae was provisionally considered valid by Rosevear (1969) but was referred to a subspecies of T. gracilis by Robbins (1974) .

DISTRIBUTION: N Sahel savanna and subdesert from Mauritania and through Mali to Niger (see Robbins, 1974 ); eastern limits unknown although Sicard et al. (1988) believed the species to be confined to the left bank of the Niger River . COMMENTS: Robbins (1974) compared his new species with samples of T. gracilis and T. pygarus . The latter and T. arenarius are sympatric in S Mauritania .
Taterillus Thomas, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:222 . TYPE SPECIES: Gerbillus emini Thomas, 1892 . SYNONYMS: Taterina . COMMENTS: A member of the tribe Taterillini in the arrangement of Pavlinov et al. (1990) . Robbins (1971) proposed a new dental terminology for the genus based on a large sample of T. gracilis , analysed (1973) nongeographic variation drawn from the same sample, and summarized (1977) morphometric and chomosomal differentiation among the seven species that he considered valid (only T. petteri has been added). Chromosomal data were reported for some species by Matthey and Petter (1970) . Like many genera of African muroid rodents, Taterillus requires critical systematic revision to determine species definitions and their distributional limits. The species now recognized are morphologically similar to one another, prompting many workers to consider them "sibling" or cryptic species ( Sicard et al., 1988 ). Whether or not such described entities represent species or allopatric segments of a larger interbreeding unit is impossible to assess without further refinement of our present taxonomic understanding of the genus.

The type locality is in S Zaire ( Ansell, 1978 ), although it has been also identified as N Zambia ( Allen, 1939 ; Bates, 1988 ). The double-grooved incisors and fringed, white-tipped tail in this species are unique among species of Tatera , thus its allocation to a separate subgenus.

Tatera Lataste, 1882 . Le Naturaliste, Paris 2:126 . TYPE SPECIES: Dipus indicus Hardwicke, 1807 . SYNONYMS: Gerbilliscus, Taterona . COMMENTS: A member of the tribe Taterillini according to Pavlinov et al. (1990) . Taxonomic revisions of various inclusiveness were provided by Pirlot (1955) and Bates (1985 , 1988 ). Davis (1975a) presented a review of the genus, in which, aside from T. boehmi , he considered all the species to cluster either in an afra group or robusta group. Chromosomal information for some species was reported by Matthey and Petter (1970) . Results of craniometric studies of Angolan Tatera were presented by Crawford-Cabral (1988) and Crawford-Cabral and Pacheco (1991) . Pavlinov et al. (1990) regarded true Tatera to consist only of the Asian species T. indica , placed all the African species in the genus Gerbilliscus (subgenera Gerbilliscus and Taterona ), and identified Taterillus as its closest relative. There are distinctive features separating the Asian from all the African species, but we are unconvinced they are not part of the same monophyletic group and treat them that way by allocating the species among the subgenera Tatera , Taterona , and Gerbilliscus .
Meriones shawi (Duvernoy, 1842) . Mem. Soc. Sci. Nancy, 3:22 . TYPE LOCALITY: Algeria , Oman .

SYNONYMS: albipes , auziensis , crassibulla, grandis , isis , laticeps , longiceps, richardii , savii , sellysii , trouessarti . COMMENTS: Subgenus Pallasiomys . A distinctive species that ranges mostly north of M. libycus but is sympatric with it in several regions ( Lay and Nadler, 1969 ; Zaime and Pascal, 1988 ). The distribution maps of Algerian M. shawi and M. libycus in Kowalski and Rzebik-Kowalska (1991) illustrate the geographic relationships of these species— mostly parapatric, but sympatric near the coast. M. shawi and M. libycus are often confused in museum collections and published reports (see the review by Lay and Nadler, 1969 ).

SYNONYMS: auceps , brevicaudatus , buechneri , cryptorhinus , fulvus , heptneri, jei, karelini, lepturus , littoralis , massagetes, muleiensis, nogaiorum, penicilliger, psamntophilus, roborowskii , shitkovi, tropini, urianchaicus , uschtaganicus, zhitkovi. COMMENTS: Subgenus Pallasiomys . The significance of intraspecific chromosomal variation among Russian samples was reported by Korobitsyna and Kartavtseva (1988) . Utilizing several sets of data, including results from hybridization studies, Dyatlov and Avanyan (1987) tested conspecificity of the subspecies meridianus , nogaiorum, and dahli , and concluded that nogaiorum should be considered a semispecies and dahli a species (see that account). We retain nogaiorum in M. meridianus pending unequivocable results demonstrating its evolutionary status. The Xinjiang population was discussed by Ma et al. (1987) .

DISTRIBUTION: Anatolian Turkey , south into Israel , Lebanon , Syria , N Iraq , NW Iran , N Transcaucasia, and Kurdistan . SYNONYMS: koenigi . COMMENTS: Corbet (1978c) included brandii in M. auratus but acknowledged that it might be a separate species, as it is treated by Niethammer (1982a, c) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . However, M. brandii was earlier revised by Lyman and O'Brien (1977) , who presented morphological, chromosomal, and breeding evidence supporting its specific status, and also provided distributional, ecological, and husbandry information. Additional chromosomal data were documented by Fang and Jagiello (In Press).

Subfamily Cricetomyinae Roberts, 1951 . Mammals S Africa, p. 434 . SYNONYMS: Saccostomurinae. COMMENTS: Although initially classified within Murinae (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ; Simpson, 1945 ; Thomas, 1897a ), systematists acknowledged a closer affinity of African pouched rats to one another than to other murines, a distinction later formalized by Roberts (1951) . Subsequent systematic arrangements have followed Petter (1966a) in allying cricetomyines with cricetids (Reig, 1980; Rosevear, 1969 ). Anatomy of internal cheek pouches supports the monophyly of the subfamily (see Ryan, 1989b ); other morphological traits and phylogenetic interpretations summarized by Carleton and Musser (1984) . Roberts (1951) segregated Saccostomus , as the lone member of Saccostomurinae, from other African pouched rats ( Cricetomyinae ), a division not recognized by later systematists ( Petter, 1966a ; Ryan, 1989b ).
Beamys Thomas, 1909 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 4:107 . TYPE SPECIES: Beamys hindei Thomas, 1909 . COMMENTS: Two species have been generally recognized as originally described (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ; Ellerman et al., 1953; Hanney, 1965 ; Misonne, 1974 ), until Ansell and Ansell (1973) suggested their synonymy, a classification adopted by others (e.g., Ansell, 1978 ; Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Honacki et al., 1982 ). Two species appear evident among USNM series, but the matter deserves the attention of a serious revision.
Cricetomys Waterhouse, 1840 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1840:2 . TYPE SPECIES: Cricetomys gambianus Waterhouse, 1840 . COMMENTS: Six nominal species were recognized (e.g., Allen, 1939 ) before Ellerman (1941) reduced all to subspecies of C. gambianus . Genest-Villard's (1967) revision provided evidence of two kinds, a predominantly savannah-dwelling species (C. gambianus ) and a lowland forest form (C. emini ). Her character states for discriminating the two species are generally workable in West Africa but break down in parts of eastern Africa, which suggests the need for additional alpha-level study.
Cricetulus kamensis (Satunin, 1903) . Ann. Zool. Mus. St. Petersbourg, 7:574 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , NE Tibet ( Xizang Prov), Mekong Dist, River Moktschjun . DISTRIBUTION: China , Tibetan Plateau. SYNONYMS: kozlovi , lama , tibetanus . COMMENTS: See discussion under C. alticola .

COMMENTS: See Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) for allocating pseudocurtatus to A. eversmanni .
Cansumys canus Allen, 1928 . J. Mammal., 9:245 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , S Gansu ( Kansu ) Prov, Choni . DISTRIBUTION: Known from vicinity of the type locality and Shaanxi Prov. , China (Wang, 1990). COMMENTS: Represented by the holotype and young animal described by Allen (1940) a specimen in the Field Museum of Natural History (36067), and Wang's (1990) record. Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , and Corbet (1978c) included canus as a form of Cricetulus triton , but Corbet and Hill (1991) listed it as a species of Cansumys .
Cricetulus barabensis (Pallas, 1773) . Reise Prov. Russ. Reichs., 2:704 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , W Siberia, banks of River Ob . DISTRIBUTION: Steppes of S Siberia from River Irtysh to Ussuri region, and south to Mongolia , N China ( Xinjiang through Nei Mongol ), and Korea . SYNONYMS: ferrugineus , fumatus , furunculus , griseus ( Milne-Edwards, 1867 , not Kashkarov, 1923), manchuricus , mongolicus , obscurus , pseudogriseus, tuvinicus , xinganensis. COMMENTS: Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) listed pseudogriseus as a species, and Corbet and Hill (1991) treated it and griseus as species. However, these were originally diagnosed by chromosomal traits, and in a study that included C. barabensis, Krâl et al. (1984) found it difficult to karyotypically characterize the three species because of the extensive homology among chromosome arms. Our treatment reflects that of Corbet (1978c) , who discussed the problem and included pseudogriseus and griseus in C. barabensis . See Malygin et al. (1992) for an opposite treatment.
Cricetulus alticola Thomas, 1917 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 19:455 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Ladak, Shushul, 13,500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from W Nepal ( Lim and Ross, 1992 ), N India in Kashmir and Ladak, and western part of Tibetan Plateau in China . COMMENTS: Feng et al. (1986) considered alticola to be a subspecies of C. kamensis , occuring in W Xizang Prov, but Corbet and Hill (1991) recognized it as a separate species.
Cansumys Allen, 1928 . J. Mammal., 9:244 . TYPE SPECIES: Cansumys canus Allen, 1928 . COMMENTS: Listed as a synonym of Cricetulus by Ellerman (1941) , Ellerman and MorrisonScott (1951), and Corbet (1978c) and of Tscherskia by Carleton and Musser (1984) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) , but Cansumys does not belong with either of these. Its combination of pelage pattern, large body size, long tail, and high-crowned selenodont-like molars make it unique among cricetines ( Ross, 1988 ).
Cricetulus Milne-Edwards, 1867 . Ann. Sci. Nat. (Paris), 7:376 . TYPE SPECIES: Cricetulus griseus Milne-Edwards, 1867 (= Mus barabensis Pallas, 1773 ). SYNONYMS: Urocricetus . COMMENTS: See comments under subfamily.

Cricetulus sokolovi Orlov and Malygin, 1988 . Zool. Zh., 67:305 . TYPE LOCALITY: W Mongolia . DISTRIBUTION: W and S Mongolia , C Nei Mongol of N China . COMMENTS: A distinctive species defined by diagnostic chromosomal and pelage traits ( Orlov and Malygin, 1988 ). Samples from the Mongolian segment of the range had been identified as C. obscurus ( Krâl et al., 1984 , and references therein; Orlov and Malygin, 1988 ); real obscurus is a form of C. barabensis .
Cricetus cricetus (Linnaeus, 1758) . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:60 . TYPE LOCALITY: Germany .

COMMENTS: Taxonomy, morphology, distribution, karyotype, and biology of European populations reviewed by Niethammer (1982b), who also noted that closest relatives are extinct species described from Pleistocene samples. More recent analyses of morphological variability among European samples were reported by Grulich (1987, 1991, and references therein). Significance of geographic range in Netherlands was discussed by Lenders and Pelzers (1982) .

COMMENTS: Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) recognized only one extant species in the genus, but current checklists recognize at least three ( Corbet, 1978c ; Corbet and Hill, 1991 ). Pieper (1984) described M. rathgeberi based on Holocene fossils from the Greek island of Armathia (off coast of Kasos Isl between Kriti and Rodhos).
Calomyscus baluchi Thomas, 1920 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 26:939 . TYPE LOCALITY: Pakistan , Baluchistan , Kelat Dist . DISTRIBUTION: W Pakistan (from NW Frontier and Swat region in the northwest south to Baluchistan ) and NC and E Afghanistan . SYNONYMS: mustersi . COMMENTS: See Vorontsov et al.

Volemys kikuchii (Kuroda, 1920) . Dobuts. Zasshi, 32:40 -41. TYPE LOCALITY: Taiwan , Mt. Morrison, 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to highlands of Taiwan ; see Lin et al. (1987) . COMMENTS: Subgenus Volemys . Zagorodnyuk (1990) listed this as the only member of the kikuchii species group in Volemys . Morphometric analyses of crania and dentitions are provided by Kaneko (1987) ; conventional karyotype reported by Harada et al. (1991) ; information about the holotype and type locality was summarized by Jones (1975).
Volemys millicens (Thomas, 1911) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1911 (100):49 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Sichuan , Weichoe, Si-ho River Valley, 12,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from mountains of E Xizang ( Tibet ; see Feng et al., 1986 ) and Sichuan , China . COMMENTS: Closely related to V. musseri according to Lawrence (1982) and Zagorodnyuk (1990) .
Volemys musseri (Lawrence, 1982) . Am. Mus. Novit., 2745:6 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Sichuan , Qionglai Shan, 30 mi W Wenquan, 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from the Qionglai Shan in W Sichuan , China , 7000- 12,000 ft. COMMENTS: Zagorodnyuk (1990) placed this species with V. millicens in the same species group. This cluster may be part of an old fauna that is peculiar to the western highlands of Sichuan (see Lawrence, 1982 ).
Calomyscus bailwardi Thomas, 1905 . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1905(24):23 . TYPE LOCALITY: Iran , Khuzistan, 120 km SE Ahwaz, Mala-i-Mir (= Jzeh) . DISTRIBUTION: Iran . SYNONYMS: grandis . COMMENTS: True bailwardi has been recorded only from Iran ; its range as usually described in the literature ( Corbet, 1978c ) represents other species of Calomyscus (Vorontsov et al., 1979) . Our distributional sketch is documented by specimens from C Iran (in the Field Museum of Natural History) and records from SW Iran (Vorontsov et al., 1979). Schütter and Setzer (1973) described grandis as a subspecies of C. bailwardi .
Subfamily Calomyscinae Vorontsov and Potapova, 1979 . Zool. Zh., 58:1393 . COMMENTS: Although earlier authors associated it with New World sigmodontines, Vorontsov and Potapova (1979) recognized Calomyscus's combination of distinctive features by setting it apart as a tribe in the subfamily Cricetinae of the family Cricetidae . Pavlinov (1980c) kept it with sigmodontines, and Agusti (1989:387) summarily regarded it as the only living member of the Myocricetodontinae. Carleton and Musser (1984:313) discussed the different taxonomic assignments of Calomyscus , its characteristics that did not fit with Old World hamsters ( Cricetinae ), and the dental similarities between Calomyscus and Miocene Democricetodon , and remarked that " Calomyscus could be justifiably classified among the cricetodontines, a group hitherto supposed extinct."
Calomyscus Thomas, 1905 . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1905(24):23 . TYPE SPECIES: Calomyscus bailwardi Thomas, 1905 . COMMENTS: Calomyscus has been considered monotypic ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Peshev, 1991 ). However, Vorontsov et al. (1979), in a comprehensive revision of the genus, treated most of the subspecies of C. bailwardi as distinct species, an arrangement that should be tested with additional data. The population from Syria was discovered only recently (see Peshev, 1991 ), indicating that the geographic ranges of living species have yet to be defined. The modern range of the genus is a remnant of a broader distribution that in the Tertiary extended as far west as Spain (see Agusti, 1989 , and references therein).
Calomyscus mystax Kashkarov, 1925 . Trans. Turkestansk. Nauch. ob-va pri Sredniaziatsk. Univ. (Tashkent), 2:43 . TYPE LOCALITY: Turkmenistan , Great Balkhan Mtns, Bashi-Mugur . DISTRIBUTION: Great and Little Balkhan and Kopet Dag Mtns and Badkhiz desert, S Turkmenia, NC ( Mazanderan Prov. ) and NE ( Khorassan Prov. ) Iran , and NW Afghanistan . SYNONYMS: elburzensis . COMMENTS: See Vorontsov et al. (1979) for status of elburzensis . See comments under C. urartensis . The Afghanistan distribution is based upon specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History; we relied on other series from that Institution and records in Vorontsov et al. (1979) for the Iranian segment.
Calomyscus hotsoni Thomas, 1920 . J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc., 26:938 . TYPE LOCALITY: Pakistan , Baluchistan , Gwambuk Kaul, 50 km SW Panjgur ( 26°30'N , 63°50'E ) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from vicinity of type locality. COMMENTS: In body size, the smallest of all the species of Calomyscus (Vorontsov et al., 1979) .
Calomyscus urartensis Vorontsov and Kartavseva, 1979 . Zool. Zh., 58: 1218 . TYPE LOCALITY: Azerbaidzhan, Nakhichevansk., Alindzhachai River , 7 km N Dzhul'ta . DISTRIBUTION: Extreme S Transcaucasus (Azerbaidzhan), far NW Iran (Azarbaijan Prov.; series in the Field Museum of Natural History). COMMENTS: C. urartensis is chromosomally and morphologically closely similar to C. mystax (Vorontsov et al., 1979, and our study of material in the Field Museum).
Calomyscus tsolovi Peshev, 1991 . Mammalia, 55: 112 . TYPE LOCALITY: Syria , Thafas, 18 km NW Derra (= Der'a) . DISTRIBUTION: SW Syria ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Described by Peshev (1991) as a subspecies of C. bailwardi , but its small size and short tail clearly distinguish it from any other described form now recognized as a species; such an option was even suggested by Peshev (1991: 112) .
Allocricetulus Argyropulo, 1933 . Z. Säugetierk., 8:133 . TYPE SPECIES: Cricetus eversmanni Brandt, 1859 .
Subfamily Cricetinae G. Fischer, 1817 . Mém. Soc. Imp. Nat. Moscow , 5:372 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Corbet (1978c , 1984 ), who (1978c:88) noted that "generic divisions within the group are rather unstable and a fresh, comprehensive classification is required," a conclusion we echo after studying specimens and literature. One of these divisions is Cricetulus , and Corbet (1978c:90) acknowledged that some species he listed there are frequently placed in Allocricetulus and Tscherskia , but "pending a review of generic classification in the subfamily as a whole," he preferred to include those genera in Cricetulus . We prefer the opposite: to recognize the separate genera until the subfamily is systematically revised. In cranial morphology, Allocricetulus closely resembles Cricetus , not Cricetulus , and the latter is more like Phodopus than either Tscherskia or Allocricetulus . Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) also treated Cricetulus , Allocricetulus, and Tscherskia as genera. Some of the Chinese hamsters were reviewed by Wang and Zheng (1973) . Keys to the European species were provided by Niethammer (1982a). Chromosomal information for European species was recorded by Zima and Krâl (1984a) . Carleton and Musser (1984) diagnosised the subfamily and reviewed general characters, major fossil groups, and other topics.
Allocricetulus curtatus Allen, 1925 . Am. Mus. Novit., 179:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , W Nei Mongol ( Inner Mongolia ), Iren Dabasu (= Ehrlien) . DISTRIBUTION: China ; "Steppes of Mongolia north of the Altai and eastwards to Inner Mongolia " ( Corbet, 1978c:92 ); also recorded from N Xinjiang Prov. in NW China ( Ma et al., 1987 ), Ningxia ( Qin, 1991 ), and Anhui ( Liu et al., 1985 ). COMMENTS: Ma et al. (1987) treated curtatus as a subspecies of A. eversmanni , but Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) and Corbet and Hill (1991) continued to recognize it as a separate species.
Proedromys bedfordi Thomas, 1911 . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1911(90):4 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Gansu ( Kansu ), 60 mi SE Minchow . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Gansu and Sichuan , China . COMMENTS: This is the only extant species in the genus. The Sichuan record is reported by Wang et al (1966) . Pleistocene fragments from Shanxi , Hebei , and Shandong have been referred to P. cf. bedfordi ( Zheng and Li, 1990 ) .
Phaulomys smithii (Thomas, 1905) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 15:493 . TYPE LOCALITY: Japan , Honshu, Hyogo Prefecture , Kobe . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from the Japanese islands of Dogo, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. SYNONYMS: kageus, okiensis. COMMENTS: Revised by Aimi (1980) as a species of Eothenomys ; evidence for including kageus was presented by Kaneko (1985) and Ando et al. (1988) . Intraspecific chromosomal variation was documented by Ando et al. (1991) .
Phenacomys ungava Merriam, 1889 . N. Am. Fauna, 2:35 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canada , Quebec Prov. , Fort Chimo, near Ungava Bay . DISTRIBUTION: S Yukon across much of Canada to E Labrador; as far south as S Alberta , along the northern Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. SYNONYMS: celatus , crassus , latimanus , mackenzii , soperi. COMMENTS: See remarks under P. intermedius and McAllister and Hoffmann (1988) on proper usage of ungava for this form.
Phenacomys intermedius Merriam, 1889 . N. Am. Fauna, 2:32 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canada , British Columbia Prov. , 20 mi NNW Kamloops . DISTRIBUTION: SW British Columbia and adjacent Alberta , Canada , south to N New Mexico , C Utah , and N California , USA ; disjunct populations in EC California and W Nevada , USA . SYNONYMS: celsus, constablei , laingi, levis , olympicus , oramontis , orophilus , preblei , pumilus , truei . COMMENTS: Howell (1926b) originally recognized three species ( intermedius , mackenzii , and ungava ) of heather voles, later reduced to two ( intermedius and ungava including mackenzii ) by Anderson (1942a , 1947 ). Crowe (1943) further lumped all under intermedius based on suspected intergrades from SW Alberta , and the recognition of a single species has been generally followed (e.g., Banfield, 1974 ; Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Hall and Cockrum, 1953 ) but not exclusively ( Cowan and Guiguet, 1965 ; Peterson, 1966a ). Foster and Peterson (1961) questioned Crowe's appreciation of ageeffects in his identification of the alledged intergrades between intermedius and ungava . As remarked by Cowan and Guiguet (1965) , the matter of their synonymy "requires more detailed examination before a decision can be reached," an appraisal which stands equally valid today. See McAllister and Hoffmann (1988 , Mammalian Species, 305, including ungava ).
Proedromys Thomas, 1911 . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1911 (90):4 . TYPE SPECIES: Proedromys bedfordi Thomas, 1911 . COMMENTS: Tribe Arvicolini . Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c) included this taxon in Microtus , but it is kept separate by Allen (1940), Wang et al. (1966) , and Gromov and Polyakov (1977) .

See Linzey (1983 , Mammalian Species, 210).
Synaptomys borealis (Richardson, 1828) . Zool. J., 3:517 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canada , District of Mackenzie, Great Bear Lake, Fort Franklin . DISTRIBUTION: Alaska to N Washington , USA , eastwards across much of interior Canada to Labrador; disjunct range segment from Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec , to C New Hampshire , USA . SYNONYMS: andersoni , artemisiae, bullatus , chapmani , dalli , innuitus , medioximus, smithi , sphagnicola , truei , wrangeli . COMMENTS: Subgenus Mictomys . Pleistocene records establish the species in the Great Basin, far to the south of its current range (see Mead et al., 1992 ).
Volemys Zagorodnyuk, 1990 . Vestn. Zool., 2:28 . TYPE SPECIES: Microtus musseri Lawrence, 1982 . COMMENTS: Tribe Arvicolini . A small group of alpine or subalpine species isolated on high mountains in SW China , N Burma and on Taiwan . All have traditionally been placed in Microtus , although their phylogenetic relationships with other species in that genus were regarded as obscure or equivocal (see the discussion in Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ).
Synaptomys Baird, 1858 . Mammalia in Repts. U.S. Expl. Surv., 8(1):558 . TYPE SPECIES: Synaptomys cooperi Baird, 1858 . SYNONYMS: Mictomys, Plioctomys . COMMENTS: Many taxonomic characters link Synaptomys with the true lemmings ( Lemmus and Myopus ) in a clade, usually treated as the tribe Lemmini , believed to represent an early line of arvicoline evolution ( Carleton, 1981 ; Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Graf, 1982 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hinton, 1926; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ). Fossil history reviewed by Koenigswald and Martin (1984) . Although described as a genus, Miller (1896) arranged Mictomys as a subgenus of Synaptomys , as conventionally recognized ( Hall, 1981 ; Howell, 1927 ). Paleontologists, however, have emphasized the dental divergence of Synaptomys and Mictomys at the generic level ( Koenigswald and Martin, 1984 ; Repenning and Grady, 1988 ), although both are presumed to have separated from a common ancestor ( Plioctomys ) in the late Pliocene. Current specific and subspecific classification essentially derives from Howell (1927) .
Prometheomys Satunin, 1901 . Zool. Anz., 24:572 . TYPE SPECIES: Prometheomys schaposchnikowi Satunin, 1901 . COMMENTS: The only extant member of an archaic line of the arvicoline radiation, which most specialists isolate as the tribe Prometheomyini within Arvicolinae ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Kretzoi, 1969 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). Repenning et al. (1990) , however, aligned Prometheomys with another presumed relic, Ellobius , in the subfamily Prometheomyinae .
Gerbillurus setzeri (Schütter, 1973) . Bull. S. California Acad. Sci., 72:13 . TYPE LOCALITY: Namibia , Gobabeb, 1 mi E Namib Desert Research Station . DISTRIBUTION: Namib Desert, from the Namib-Naukluft Nat. Park north through Namibia to extreme SW Angola ( Meester et al., 1986 ; Skinner and Smithers, 1990 ). COMMENTS: Subgenus Gerbillurus . Interpretation of chromosomal data indicated G. setzeri and G. tytonis are closely related (Qumsiyeh et al., 1991). Reviewed by Griffin (1990) , who also refered to an undescribed form (G. cf. setzeri ) coexisting with G. setzeri .

SYNONYMS: broomi , calidus , coombsi, exilis , infernus, kalaharicus, leucanthus, mulleri , oralis , swakopensis, swalius , tenuis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Progerbillurus . Meester et al. (1986) and Skinner and Smithers (1990) summarized South African taxonomy and distribution; Griffin (1990) reviewed Namibian populations. Based on analyses of chromosomal data, Qumsiyeh (1986) hypothesized that G. paeba and G. vallinus evolved from a common ancestor.

Gerbillurus Shortridge, 1942 . Ann. S. Afr. Mus., 36:27 -1. TYPE SPECIES: Gerbillus vallinus Thomas, 1918 . SYNONYMS: Paratatera, Progerbillurus . COMMENTS: Concordance of morphological, allozymic, and chromosomal data supports the monophyly of Gerbillurus and indicates its close relationship to the robusta group of Taterillus ( Qumsiyeh et al., 1987 , and references therein). Pavlinov (1987) and Pavlinov et al. (1990) , however, considered Gerbillurus to be a sister-species of Desmodillus and to form the monophyletic tribe Gerbillurini. Comparisons in thermal parameters, macro-and micro-environments, and interspecific aggression among four sympatric species of Gerbillurus were documented by Downs and Perrin (1989 , 1990) and Dempster and Perrin (1990) in context of adaptive significance and phylogenetic relationships. Standard karyotypic data reported by Schütter et al. (1984), and an hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among the four species, derived from chromosomal data was advanced by Qumsiyeh et al. (1991).
Desmodillus Thomas and Schwann, 1904 . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1904(2):6 . TYPE SPECIES: Gerbillus auricularis Smith, 1834 . COMMENTS: A South African endemic that is a member of the tribe Gerbillurini , along with Gerbillurus , in the classification scheme of Pavlinov et al. (1990) .

Gerbillus acticola Thomas, 1918 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 2:147 . TYPE LOCALITY: Somalia , Berbera . DISTRIBUTION: Somalia . COMMENTS: Lay (1983) explained why Petter's (1975b) synonomy of G. acticola with G. pyramidum should not be followed.
Gerbillus agag Thomas, 1903 . Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1903:296 . TYPE LOCALITY: Sudan , W Kordofan, Agageh Wells . DISTRIBUTION: N Nigeria , Mali , and Niger to Chad , Sudan , and Kenya . COMMENTS: The forms cosensi , maradius, nigeriae , and sudanensis have been associated with G. agag , but Lay (1983) found the limits of this species impossible to define based on published analyses and regarded it as monotypic pending systematic revision.
Gerbillus Desmarest, 1804 . Tabi. Méth. Hist Nat., in Nouv. Diet. Hist. Nat., 24:22 . TYPE SPECIES: Gerbillus aegyptius Desmarest, 1804 (= Dipus gerbillus Olivier, 1801 ). SYNONYMS: Dipodillus , Endecapleura , Hendecapleura , Monodia , Petteromys . COMMENTS: This genus has never been adequately revised. Lay (1983) summarized taxonomic difficulties of the genus, discussed significant character complexes that would bear on any scheme to separate species into subgenera (nature of plantar surfaces, size of auditory bulla, relative tail length, dental traits, accessory tympanum, and karyotype), and provided an annotated checklist of the species he considered valid. Lack of concordance among the suites of characters discouraged Lay from allocating species to higher categories conventionally recognized as either subgenera or genera ( Dipodillus , Hendecapleura , Monodia , Petteromys ; see Pavlinov et al., 1990 ), and Lay felt compelled to recognize a single genus without subgenera until the group was systematically re-evaluated. No such comprehensive revision has emerged since 1983, and Lay's taxonomic overview remains the best working hypothesis of specific diversity in Gerbillus . With a few departures, we follow his treatment. Pavlinov et al. (1990) recognized subgenera of Gerbillus but admitted the weakness of these categories. An excellent account of species occurring east of the Euphrates River was provided by Lay and Nadler (1975) . The distribution of six species endemic to North Africa was mapped and discussed by Cheylan (1990) in the context of assessing endemism and speciation of Mediterranean mammals. Tranier and Julien-Laferriere (1990) commented on suggested identities of several species from North Africa. A contribution to allozymic variation within and between species was offered by Nevo (1982) . Evolutionary tendencies within Gerbillus , as reflected in dental traits, were discussed by Petter (1973c) . And the significance of variation in incisor microstructure within the genus was reported by Flynn (1982). Species of Gerbillus were included by Bonhomme et al. (1985) and Pascale et al. (1990) in their assessment of phylogenetic relationships among muroid rodents with electrophoretic and DNAsequence data.

Steatomys jacksoni Hayman, 1936 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1935:930 [1936]. TYPE LOCALITY: Ghana , Ashanti , Wenchi . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from type locality and SW Nigeria . COMMENTS: This species was known only by the holotype , but a few specimens have been recorded from SW Nigeria ( Anadu, 1979 ), and earlier Rosevear (1969) had suggested that two young animals from Wulehe, Togo , might be examples of S. jacksoni . Included in S. pratensis by Coetzee (1977a) , but retained as a species by Swanepoel and Schütter (1978), who preferred to recognize it until significance of the diagnostic character (size and shape of interparietal) could be assessed by additional specimens.
Prionomys batesi Dollman, 1910 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 6:228 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Ja River, Bitye, 2000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from W and S Cameroon and S Central African Republic ; limits unknown. COMMENTS: Petter (1966b) discussed P. batesi from Central African Republic and contrasted its morphology with that of Dendroprionomys . The specimen from W Cameroon ( 55 km NE Obala) is in the American Museum of Natural History (241344).
Steatomys cuppedius Thomas and Hinton, 1920 . Novit. Zool., 27:318 . TYPE LOCALITY: Nigeria , Farniso (= Panisau), near Kano , 1700 ft . DISTRIBUTION: A W African endemic occurring from Senegal to NC Nigeria and SC Niger (see map in Swanepoel and Schütter, 1978); actual range unresolved. COMMENTS: Revised by Swanepoel and Schütter (1978), who regarded cuppedius as a distinct species and not a member of S. parvus , as Coetzee (1977a) had indicated.

Megadendromus nikolausi Deiterlen and Rupp, 1978 . Z. Säugetierk., 43:131 . TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , S Goba, Bale Mtns . DISTRIBUTION: Apparently endemic to the Bale Mtns of Ethiopia . COMMENTS: Known only by two complete specimens and two fragmented skulls extracted from owl pellets ( Demeter and Topal, 1982 ; Dieterlen and Rupp, 1978 ). Morphology and ecology were reported by Dieterlen and Rupp (1978) ; Demeter and Topal (1982) provided additional habitat information.
Steatomys Peters, 1846 . Bericht Verhandl. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin , 11:258 . TYPE SPECIES: Steatomys pratensis Peters, 1846 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Coetzee (1977a) . Rosevear (1969) provided an excellent review of the West African species, and Swanepoel and Schütter (1978) produced a more comprehensive revision of them. Still, the widely distributed species such as S. pratensis and S. parvus need careful systematic revision to better resolve actual diversity of species represented in samples and their geographic ranges.

Subfamily Gerbillinae Gray, 1825 . Ann. Philos., n.s., 10:342 . SYNONYMS: Ammodillini , Desmodilliscini, Gerbillurini , Merionidae, Pachyuromyini , Rhombomyini , Taterillinae. COMMENTS: Whether viewed as a subfamily or family, species of gerbils form a distinct group defined by a suite of derived traits (see Carleton and Musser, 1984 ). In a series of reports, Pavlinov (1980 a, 1981 , 1982, 1985, 1987) presented analyses of skeletal and dental characters of gerbils and developed a hypothesis of their phylogeny and a classification. The monograph by Pavlinov et al. (1990) represents a culmination of these efforts, in which the phylogeny, species classification, morphology, ecology, and geographical distribution of Gerbillidae are comprehensively reviewed. Cytogenetic data for the subfamily summarized by Qumsiyeh and Schütter (1991) and Viegas-Pequignot et al. (1986) . Rates of protein, chromosomal, and morphological evolution in four genera reported by Qumsiyeh and Chesser (1988) . Chromosomal and biochemical results of several genera documented and discussed in a phylogenetic context by Benazzou et al. (1984) . Anatomy, physiology, adaptive significance, and evolution of the middle and inner ear of gerbillines documented by Lay (1972) and Pavlinov (1988) ; significance of acoustic emissions and morphology of cochlea in context of adaptation and systematics reported by Bridelance (1987) and Plassmann et al. (1987) ; and the relationship of acoustical adaptations in relation to steppe and desert environments summarized by Petter et al. (1984) . The origin and evolution of North African gerbils discussed by Tong (1989) whose results were presented in a phylogenetic classification of genera and compared with other classifications based on morphological, chromosomal, and biochemical data. Palearctic species reviewed by Corbet (1978c , 1984 ); Russian species checklisted by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . See Pavlinov et al.

Dendromus vernayi Hill and Carter, 1937 . Am. Mus. Novit., 913:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: EC Angola , Chitau, 4930 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality ( Hill and Carter, 1941 ; Crawford-Cabral, 1986). COMMENTS: Hill and Carter described vernayi as a subspecies of D. mesomelas , an association which has not been questioned ( Bohmann, 1942 ; Misonne, 1974 ; Crawford-Cabral, 1986). Our study of the holotype and original series revealed vernayi to be distinguished from mesomelas by its smaller size, bright buffy venter, much shorter tail, and shorter and stubby rostrum. No data supports its affiliation with D. mesomelas as a subspecies and it is clearly distinct from the much larger D. insignis .
Dendromus mystacalis Heuglin, 1863 . Nova Acta Acad. Caes. Leop.-Carol., Halle, 30:2 , suppl. 5. TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Baschlo region (Ellerman et al., 1953, offered additional comments) . DISTRIBUTION: From South Africa (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:308 ) north through most of the continent to Ethiopia , S Sudan , Zaire , and N Angolaand IUCN; extent of range unknown. SYNONYMS: acraeus , ansorgei , capitis, jamesoni , lineatus , nairobae , ochropus , pallescens, pongolensis, uthmoelleri, whytei.
Dendromus oreas Osgood, 1936 . Field Mus. Nat. Hist., Zool. Ser., 20:236 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cameroon , Southwest Prov., southwest side of Mt. Cameroon , 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Possibly endemic to mountains of extreme E Cameroon in the Southest Prov.; recorded from Mt. Cameroon and Mt. Kupe and Mt. Manenguba in the massif about 70 mi northeast of Mt. Cameroon ( Osgood, 1936 ; Rosevear, 1969 ). COMMENTS: Although originally described by Osgood (1936) as a distinct species, oreas was later included in D. mesomelas ( Bohmann, 1942 ; Rosevear, 1969 ; Misonne, 1974 ). Our study of the holotype supports Osgood's (1936) view that oreas may be related to D. lunaris (= kivu ), but is not a geographic sample of D. insignis . Judged from the wide range in length of upper molar row that Rosevear (1969:472) recorded for oreas , his Cameroon sample is either extremely variable, which is unusual in this group, or consists of two species.
Dendromus mesomelas Brants, 1827 . Het. Geslacht der Muizen, p. 122 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , E Cape Prov. , Sunday's River, east of Port Elizabeth . DISTRIBUTION: Discontinuous ranges in South Africa (SW Cape Prov. east to Natal and E Transvaal), C Mozambique , extreme NE Zambia , N Botswana (see Map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:307 ), extreme NW and NE Zaire ( Ansell, 1978 ), highlands of N and S Malawi ( Ansell and Dowsett, 1988 ), mountains of SW (Rungwe) and EC (Uluguru) Tanzania , and SE Zaire (Marungu); extent of range unresolved. SYNONYMS: ayresi , hintoni, major , nyasae , pumilio , typicus , typus . COMMENTS: We treat some of the names usually included in D. mesomelas (see Misonne, 1974 ) as distinct species (see accounts of insignis , kivu , oreas , and vernayi ). Judged by our study of specimens, samples from SE Zaire and SW Tanzania are morphologically similar to series of D. kivu , and the relationship among these and samples of true mesomelas has to be resolved by critical systematic revision. We include major , which was described as a subspecis of D. mesomelas (see St. Leger, 1930 ), but its relationships should be reexamined because of its large body size.

Deomys Thomas, 1888 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1888:130 . TYPE SPECIES: Deomys furrugineus Thomas, 1888 . COMMENTS: Although currently included in Dendromurinae , the morphological traits of Deomys do not fit well in that group ( Rosevear, 1969 ), and influenced Ellerman (1941) to erect the Deomyinae to contain the genus (see the discussion in Carleton and Musser, 1984 ).
Leimacomys Matschie, 1893 . Sitzb. Ges. Naturf. Fr. Berlin , p. 107 . TYPE SPECIES: Leimacomys buettneri Matschie, 1893 . SYNONYMS: Limacomys . COMMENTS: Apparently more closely related to Steatomys than to other dendromurines ( Dieterlen, 1976a ). Rosevear (1969) provided a particularly good summary of past taxonomic allocations of Leimacomys and the nature of the type specimens.
Malacothrix Wagner, 1843 . In Schreber, Die Säugethiere, Suppl., 3:496 . TYPE SPECIES: Otomys typicus A. Smith, 1834 . SYNONYMS: Otomys (Smith, 1834, not Cuvier, 1823). COMMENTS: Generally considered monotypic ( Meester et al., 1986 ), but this view needs testing by systematic revision. See Matthey (1967) for reference to chromosomal information and karyological contrasts with other dendromurine genera.
Megadendromus Dieterlen and Rupp, 1978 . Z. Säugetierk., 43:129 . TYPE SPECIES: Megadendromus nikolausi Dieterlen and Rupp, 1978 . COMMENTS: A spectacular dendromurine with derived molar traits that were interpreted by Dieterlen and Rupp (1978) to indicate a closer relationship between Dendromurinae and Murinae than was previously suspected.
Dendromus Smith, 1829 . Zool. J. London, 4:438 . TYPE SPECIES: Dendromus typus Smith, 1829 (= Mus mesomelas Brants, 1827 ). SYNONYMS: Chortomys , Dendromys , Poemys . COMMENTS: In his checklist of African mammals, Allen (1939) listed 28 species of Dendromus , which was reduced to four by Bohmann's (1942) revision. Dieterlen (1971) focused on reporting morphological, ecological, and other traits of the central African forms and recognized five species from that region. We recognize eleven. Definitions of D. kahuziensis , D. lovati , D. insignis , D. vernayi , and D. nyikae are clear, even though the first two are known by few specimens. Four ( D. melanotis , D. mesomelas , D. messorius , and D. mystacalis ) need to be systematically revised—each may actually be a complex of species; some synonyms associated with each of them may be incorrectly allocated. Two others, D. kivu and D. oreas require critical comparison with samples of true D. mesomelas to resolve their affinities. Chromosomal information for several species was reported by Matthey (1967, 1970).
Saccostomus mearnsi Heller, 1910 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 54:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Coast Prov., Changamwe . DISTRIBUTION: Extreme S Ethiopia and S Somalia , through E Uganda and Kenya , to NE Tanzania . SYNONYMS: cricetulus , isiolae , umbriventer . COMMENTS: See remarks under generic account.
Saccostomus campestris Peters, 1846 . Bericht Verhandl. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin , 11:258 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mozambique , Tete Dist. , Zambezi River, Tete . DISTRIBUTION: Broadly occurring in arid to mesic southern savannahs and grasslands: from SW Tanzania across to C Angola ; south through most of Malawi , Zambia , Zimbabwe , Botswana , and Namibia ; to S Mozambique and Cape Province , South Africa . SYNONYMS: anderssoni , angolae , elegans , fuscus , hildae , lapidarius , limpopoensis , mashonae , pagei , streeteri . COMMENTS: A composite of two or more species as suggested by extraordinary chromosomal variation (Gordon, 1986; Gordon and Rautenbach, 1980 ); the status of anderssoni and mashonae especially deserves attention in regard to campestris proper.
Saccostomus Peters, 1846 . Bericht Verhandl. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss., Berlin , 11:258 . TYPE SPECIES: Saccostomus campestris Peters, 1846 . SYNONYMS: Eosaccomys . COMMENTS: Ellerman (1941) thought that all nominal forms would prove to be races of the single species S. campestris , a speculation widely observed in later classifications and faunal reports (e.g., Delany, 1975 ; Ellerman et al., 1953; Kingdon, 1974; Misonne, 1974 ). Hubert (1978a) , however, presented karyotypic and morphological evidence that differentiates an eastern African species (S. mearnsi ) from a southern African one ( S. campestris ), as earlier intimated by Allen and Lawrence (1936) .
Subfamily Dendromurinae Alston, 1876 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1876:82 . SYNONYMS: Deomyinae, Dendromyinae. COMMENTS: Carleton and Musser (1984) provided diagnosis of the subfamily, general characters, habits, habitats, and other information; summarized historical judgments about relationships of the group, which by 1984 had disassociated dendromurines from murines and either aligned them to "cricetids" or treated them as a separate family ( Chaline et al., 1977 ); and cautioned that more research was required to determine if the dendromurines as currently defined are a natural group or instead a polyphyletic assemblage of specialized relicts evolved from a primitive African muroid stock. The association of dendromurines as a subfamily of Cricetidae was retained by Lindsay (1988) . Extant members of Dendromurinae are found only in Subsaharan Africa ( Dieterlen, 1971 ), and the group is represented in parts of that region by Pleistocene, Pliocene, and Miocene fossils ( Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; Conroy et al., 1992 ; Lavocat, 1978 ; Senut et al., 1992 ), and in North Africa by Miocene samples ( Lindsay, 1988 ). But at one time the geographic range of dendromurines extended beyond Africa: examples of Dendromus are recorded from the late Miocene deposits of S Spain , and extinct genera mark the first appearance of dendromurines in the middle Miocene of Pakistan and Thailand ( Lindsay, 1988 , and references therein).
Dendromus melanotis Smith, 1834 . S. Afr. Quart. J., 2: 158 . TYPE LOCALITY: South Africa , near Port Natal (Durban) . DISTRIBUTION: From South Africa (see map in Skinner and Smithers, 1990:306 ) north to Uganda , and west through Nigeria to Mt-Nimba in Guinea ; also from Ethiopia (# 8119 in American Museum of Natural History), but published records might be D. mystacalis ( Yalden et al., 1976 ) . Limits of range unresolved. SYNONYMS: arenarius , basuticus, capensis , carteri, chiversi , concinnus , exoneratus , insignis ( Shortridge and Carter, 1938 , not Thomas, 1903 ), leucostomus , nigrifrons , pallidus , pretoriae, shortridgei , spectabilis , subtilis , thorntoni, vulturnus.
Dendromus insignis (Thomas, 1903) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 12:341 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kenya , Nandi . DISTRIBUTION: Discontinuous highland range from Ethiopia ( Yalden et al., 1976 , recorded under mesomelas ), E Kenya ( Hollister, 1919 ), Western Rift mountains from W Uganda south to Rwanda , and Mt. Kilimanjaro in NE Tanzania ; extent of montane distribution unknown. SYNONYMS: abyssiniens , kilimandjari, percivali . COMMENTS: Although insignis is now included in D. mesomelas ( Bohmann, 1942 ; Misonne, 1974 ), Thomas (1916b) noted that the "lumping of insignis with the southern D. mesomelas " appeared to be "unfounded," an evaluation matching our conclusion based on study of specimens. D. insignis is easily distinguished from D. mesomelas by its very large body size and cranial traits. Furthermore, it occurs at the same localities in the Western Rift mountains as D. kivu , which is the species most like D. mesomelas . Bohmann (1939) described kilimandjari as a subspecies of D. mesomelas .
Dendromus kivu Thomas, 1916 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 18:242 . TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , near Lake Kivu, Buhamba, 2000 m . DISTRIBUTION: A possible montane Western Rift endemic; recorded from the west and east slopes of the Ruwenzoris in E Zaire and W Uganda ( Osgood, 1936 , and specimens in the Field Museum of Natural History) and the Kivu region in E Zaire (samples in the American Museum of Natural History and the British Museum of Natural History). SYNONYMS: lunaris . COMMENTS: Osgood (1936:236) discussed two series of Dendromus collected at the same time and place on the western slope of Mt. Ruwenzori. He described one as D. lunaris , based on two examples, and identified the other as D. insignis , a conclustion we verified from study of his specimens. The two species are also sympatric in the Kivu Region (series in American Museum of Natural History). Thomas originally described kivu as a subspecies of D. insignis , but our study of the holotype reveals it to be the same as Osgood's lunaris , which it predates. Both kivu and insignis have been included in D. mesomelas ( Bohmann, 1942 ; Misonne, 1974 ). It is the smallerbodied kivu that is morphologically similar to D. mesomelas and the nature of the relationship between the two will have to be revealed by systematic revision of the mesomelas group.
Dendromus kahuziensis Dieterlen, 1969 . Z. Säugetierk., 34:348 -353. TYPE LOCALITY: Zaire , Kivu, Mt Kahuzi, 2100 m . DISTRIBUTION: Zaire , Kivu region . COMMENTS: A very distinct long-tailed species known only by few specimens from moss forest-bamboo habitat ( Dieterlen, 1969a , 1976c ).
Dendromus lovati de Winton, 1900 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1899:986 [1900]. TYPE LOCALITY: Ethiopia , Managasha, near Addis Ababa . DISTRIBUTION: Endemic to Ethiopian Plateau where it is recorded from 2500-3550 m ( Rupp, 1980 ; Yalden et al., 1976 ). COMMENTS: A grassland species differing from other members of Dendromus in its apparently strictly terrestrial habits ( Yalden et al., 1976 ; Yalden, 1988 ).
Microtus lusitanicus (Gerbe, 1879) . Rev. Mag. Zool. Paris, Ser. 3, 7:44 . TYPE LOCALITY: Portugal . DISTRIBUTION: Portugal , NW Spain, and SW France (see Niethammer, 1982/). SYNONYMS: depressus , gerritmilleri, hurdanensis, marine, pelandonius , planiceps . COMMENTS: Subgenus Terricola , duodecimcostatus species group sensu Chaline et al. (1988) . Spitz (1978) provided craniometric analyses in context of contrasting M. lusitanicus with M. duodecimcostatus and M. gerbei . Reviewed by Niethammer (1982;) and Corbet (1984) ; chromosomal data reviewed by Zima and Krâl (1984a) . Both Graf (1982) and Chaline and Graf (1988) apparently used mariae for this species, which reflects Winking's (1976) usage in separating the latter from M. duodecimcostatus ; however, the proper name is lusitanicus (Niethammer (1982;).
Microtus kirgisorum (Ognev, 1950) . [ Mammals of USSR and Adjacent Countries], 7:219 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kazakhstan , Tuyouk, Khirgiski Mtns . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from S Kazakhstan , Kirghizia , Tadzhikistan , and SE Turkmenistan ; may also occur in N Afghanistan . COMMENTS: Subgenus Microtus , arvalis species group sensu Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Originally described as a subspecies of M. arvalis but later elevated to a separate species (Meier, 1983; Meier et al., 1981), as observed by Corbet (1984) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Chromosomal data presented by Orlov et al. (1983) in context of phylogenetic study among members of the M. arvalis group.
Microtus kermanensis Roguin, 1988 . Rev. Suisse Zool., 95:601 . TYPE LOCALITY: Iran , Kerman Prov. , Zahrud-e Bala, 70 km S Kerman , 2700 m . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from two isolated mountain populations in SE Iran : Kuh-e Laleh-Zar and Kuh-e Hazar S of Kerman (see Roguin, 1988 ).

Microtus limnophilus Büchner, 1889 . Wiss. Res. Przewalski Cent .-Asien. Reis. Zool., I:(Saugeth.), p. 110 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Qinghai . DISTRIBUTION: From Qinghai Prov. to W Mongolia . COMMENTS: Subgenus Pallasiinus , oeconomus species group sensu Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Formerly included in M. oeconomus but separated as a species parapatric with M. oeconomus in W Mongolia ( Malygin et al., 1990 , and references therein).
Microtus leucurus (Blyth, 1863) . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 32:89 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Ladakh, near Lake Chomoriri (= Tsomoriri) . DISTRIBUTION: Chinese provinces of S Qinghai ( Zheng and Wang, 1980 ) and Xizang ( Feng et al., 1986 ) on the Tibetan Plateau , and high altitudes in the Himalayas west to Kashmir (see Niethammer, 1970 ). SYNONYMS: everesti , petulans, strauchi , waltoni , zadoensis. COMMENTS: Classified by Zagorodnyuk (1990) under the subgenus Phaiomys of the genus Neodon ; others have recognized Phaiomys as a genus ( Repenning et al., 1990 ). Whatever its ranking, leucurus may date from the early evolution of the genus, as suggested by its association with the late Pliocene Allophaiomys , a taxon regarded by most as ancestral to Microtus (see Martin, 1989b ; Repenning et al., 1990 ). As classified in the genus Microtus , this species can still be called leucurus ; the older leucurus Gerbe, 1852, is a synonym of nivalis , a species which has been reallocated from Microtus to Chionomys (see that account).
Microtus longicaudus (Merriam, 1888) . Am. Nat., 22:934 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , South Dakota , Custer Co., Black Hills, Custer, 5500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Rocky Mountains and adjacent foothills, from E Alaska and N Yukon , south through British Columbia and SW Alberta , Canada , to E California and W Colorado ; including Pacific coastal taiga to N California ; disjunct southern pockets in S California , Arizona , and New Mexico , USA . SYNONYMS: abditus, alticola , angusticeps , angustus , baileyi , bernardinus, cautus , coronarius , halli , incanus , latus, leucophaeus , littoralis , macrurus , mordax , sierrae , vellerosus . COMMENTS: Sometimes viewed as a Nearctic member of Chionomys ( Anderson, 1959 ), or allocated to subgenus Microtus ( Chaline, 1974 ; Hall, 1981 ), or to subgenus Aulacomys ( Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ) . Although strongly differentiated relative to other North American Microtus (e.g., Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Modi, 1987 ; Moore and Janecek, 1990 ), the phyletic affinity of M. longicaudus lies with this complex and not Old World Chionomys ( Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). The extensive karyotypic variation reported (Judd and Cross , 1980) suggests the need for taxonomic revision. Jones et al. (1986) viewed coronarius as an insular derivative and subspecies of M. longicaudus. See Smolen and Keller (1987 , Mammalian Species, 271).
Microtus majori Thomas, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:419 . TYPE LOCALITY: Turkey , Trabzon Prov. , Sumela (= Meryemana), 30 mi S Trebizond (= Trabzon ) .

SYNONYMS: ciscaucasicus , colchicus , dinniki , fingerì, labensis, rubelianus , transcaucasicus, vinogradovi (see Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . COMMENTS: Subgenus Terricola . Included in the subterraneus species group by Chaline et al. (1988); considered the sole member of its own species group by Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Reviewed by Kratochvll and Krâl (1974), Storch (1982) and Corbet (1978c , 1984 ). The European Turkish population was discussed by Kivanc (1986) . Zima and Krâl (1984a) and Achverdjan et al.

DISTRIBUTION: NC Siberia, from the Polar Ural Mtns to the N Lena River region , south in Urals to 62°N , and in the Lena Valley near Yakutsk. SYNONYMS: obscurus , ryphaeus, swerevi, tasensis, uralensis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alexandromys , middendorffi species group sensu Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Meier (1983) considered M. middendorffi to be phylogenetically distant from other northern and central Asian species of Microtus .
Microtus mexicanus (Saussure, 1861) . Rev. Mag. Zool. Paris, Ser. 2, 13:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Puebla , Volcan de Orizaba . DISTRIBUTION: Highly dissected in mountains from extreme S Utah and SW Colorado , USA , south in Sierra Madrés through interior Mexico to C Oaxaca . STATUS: U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered as M. m. hualpaiensis; IUCN - Indeterminate as M. m. navaho. SYNONYMS: fulviventer , fundatus, guadalupensis, hualpaiensis, madrensis , mogollonensis , navaho, neveriae, phaeus , salvus, subsimus. COMMENTS: Interspecific affinities unclear: affiliated with Microtus sensu stricto, in particular M. californicus , by Anderson (1959 , 1960 ); associated with members of subgenus Pitymys by Hooper and Hart (1962) ; genic similarity to M. montanus and M. pennsylvanicus disclosed by Moore and Janecek (1990) ; also see Hoffmann and Koeppl, 1985 ); chromosomal banding data uninformative ( Modi, 1987 ). Morphometric, electrophoretic, and karyotypic variation among isolated populations in southwestern USA studied by Wilhelm (1982) . Musser (1964) reduced fulviventer to a subspecies of M. mexicanus .
Microtus guentheri (Danford and Alston, 1880) . Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1880:62 . TYPE LOCALITY: Turkey , Maras Prov., Taurus Mtns, near Maras (= Marash) . DISTRIBUTION: S Bulgaria , S Yugoslavia , E Greece , and W Turkey (see Niethammer, 1982e ). SYNONYMS: hartingi , lydius , macedonicus , martinoi, strandzensis. COMMENTS: Subgenus Microtus , sodalis species group sensu Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Gromov and Polyakov (1977) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) placed this species in subgenus Sumeriomys , but Zagorodnyuk (1990) left it in the subgenus Microtus . Corbet (1978c) initially included guentheri in M. sodalis but later recognized its specific distinctness ( Corbet, 1984 ), which was earlier demonstrated by Felten et al. (1971) and Morlok (1978) . Harrison and Bates (1991) continued to unite guentheri with M. socialis . Reviewed by Niethammer (1982c) ; chromosomal data summarized and reviewed by Zima and Krâl (1984a) .
Microtus gerbei (Gerbe, 1879) . Le Naturaliste, 1:51 . TYPE LOCALITY: France , Loire-Inferieure, Dreneuf . DISTRIBUTION: SW France , and the Pyrenees Mtns of France and Spain (see Krapp, 1982d ). SYNONYMS: brunneus , pyrenaicus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Terricola , savii species group sensu both Chaline et al. (1988) and Zagorodnyuk (1990) . This species was reviewed by Krapp (1982d) under the name pyrenaicus , but according to Spitz (1978) the latter is a nomen dubium and gerbei assumes priority. The species was included in savii by Corbet (1978c) , but chromosomal evidence and craniometric analysis underscore its specific integrity ( Kratochvil and Krâl, 1974 ; Spitz, 1978 ). Chromosomal data (as pyrenaicus ) summarized by Zima and Krâl (1984a) .
Microtus fortis Büchner, 1889 . Wiss. Res. Przewalski's Cent .- Asien. Reisen, Zool., I:(Säugeth.), p. 99 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Nei Mongol , Ordos Desert, Huang Ho Valley, Sujan . DISTRIBUTION: Transbaikalia and Amur region south through Nei Mongol and E China to lower Yangtse Valley and Fujian (see Kovalskaya et al., 1988 ). SYNONYMS: calamarum, dolichocephalus , fujianensis, michnoi , pelliceus , uliginosus. COMMENTS: Subgenus Alexandromys . Geographic variation in chromosomal traits and its significance was reported by Kovalskaya et al. (1988 ; 1991 ). Most researchers view this species as a close phylogenetic relative of M. mongolicus (Meier, 1983; Radjabli et al., 1984 ). Zagorodnyuk (1990) listed M. fortis as the only member of its species group and related to the M. middendorffi group, which contains M. middendorffi , M. miurus , M. mongolicus , and M. sachalinensis .

Intraspecific variation in chromosomal traits among Mongolian samples documented by Kovalskaya (1989) and earlier chromosomal data summarized and reviewed by Zima and Krâl (1984a) . Based on morphological and zoogeographic criteria, Rausch (1964) considered the North American miurus to be conspecific with Asian gregalis , a connection refuted by Fedyk (1970) with chromosomal data and by Vorontsov and Lyapunova (1986) . Zagorodnyuk (1990) emphasized the karyotypic divergence between gregalis and miurus by listing the latter in the M. middendorffi species group along with M. mongolicus and M. sachalinensis , subgenus Alexandromys .
Microtus juldaschi (Severtzov, 1879) . Sap. Turk . Otd. Obsh. Lubit. Estestv., 1:63 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kirghizia , Kara Kul Lake basin, near Aksu .

SYNONYMS: Carruthers, pamirensis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Neodon , a member of its own species group ( Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). The status of the distinctive Carruthers is unresolved: treated as a separate species ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Ognev, 1964 ); then synonymized with juldaschi ( Corbet, 1978c ) ; and listed as a synonym of the latter but with question ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ). Chromosomal analyses by Gileva et al. (1982) revealed two distinctive groups, which they considered to be two species but with probable different boundaries than usually described for juldaschi and Carruthers.
Microtus irene (Thomas, 1911) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1911 (90):5 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Sichuan , Tatsienlu .

COMMENTS: Subgenus Neodon . Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) listed irene as a valid species, but Corbet (1978c) allocated it to Pitymys sikimensis , citing Gruber's (1969) "detailed study" as substantiation. However, the union of irene and sikimensis is insufficiently demonstated by the data of Gruber, who even summarized the trenchant differences in body size and molar occlusal patterns that clearly distinguish the two. Furthermore, Feng et al. (1986) recorded irene from E Tibet and sikimensis from just west of that locality, without evidence of overlap in the diagnostic features of each species.

Reviewed by Gromov and Polyakov (1977) . Corbet (1978c) included hyperboreus in M. middendorffi because Gileva (1972) had demonstrated their complete interfertility. Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) , however, recognized M. hyperboreus , noting that the two are clearly morphologically distinct and that material in published studies probably omitted true hyperboreus . Meier (1983) recognized the two species as closely related and noted that no study of variability within middendorffi had been made, and more importantly, that insufficient material from the type locality had been analyzed. Vorontsov and Lyapunova (1976) considered M. hyperboreus and M. middendorffi to be chromosomally closely related to North American M. miurus .

Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) listed M. irani in the subgenus Sumeriomys , a name not recognized by Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Corbet (1978c) and Harrison and Bates (1991) included irani in M. socialis , but the two are distinct species as documented by Morlok (1978) and Kock and Nader (1983) , who also noted that most records of M. guentheri from Syria , Lebanon , and Israel are M. irani and that philistinus may be an older name for irani . The isolated Lybian population was reviewed, under mustersi , by Ranck (1968) . The status of paradoxus (from Kopet Dag Mtns) deserves reevaluation: Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) treated it as a synonym of irani but Zagorodnyuk (1990) maintained it as distinct.

COMMENTS: Nowhere are the explosiveness and recency of arvicoline evolution more dramatically highlighted than by the inconsistency of systematic treatment of genusgroup taxa to be subsumed by Microtus . No consensus exists concerning the morphological limits or monophyly of many of these taxa, a situation which in part reflects the narrow reliance of our classifications on dental characters undergoing rapid change (see Guthrie, 1971 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ). Such variability and inconsistency of systematic opinion are epitomized by the taxon Pitymys . As noted by Carleton and Musser (1984:321) , "Generally, paleontologists and European mammalogists accord Pitymys separate generic status ( Corbet, 1978c ; Koenigswald, 1980 ; Repenning, 1983 ), whereas North American workers view it as a subgenus of Microtus ( Hall, 1981 ; Jones et al., 1975)." The geographic split among systematists is by itself instructive, as is the nature of the character base consulted by paleontologists versus neontologists. Similar disputes have surrounded the taxonomic history of other genus-group taxa associated with Microtus, such as Arvicola , Blanfordimys, Chionomys, Lasiopodomys, Neodon, Phaiomys, and Proedromys. Zagorodnyuk (1990) developed an interesting reclassification of Microtus and its kin. Although probably wrong on details, we believe that it offers an important philosophical alternative in the continuing examination of relationships among Microtus-like forms. In his arrangement of Arvicolini, Zagorodnyuk emphasized hypotheses of intracontinental origin and regional diversification of major clades of Microtus . Thus, pitymyine forms of the Old World (Terricola) are segregated from those of the New World (Pitymys); New World common voles (Mynomes) are separated from Old World voles such as Microtus proper, Alexandromys, and Agricola; and the invasion of the New World semiaquatic niche is recognized (Aulacomys) as independent of the Old World water-vole radiation (Arvicola). If we interpret them correctly, such a viewpoint is consistent with the preliminary results emerging from electrophoretic studies ( Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Graf, 1982 ; Moore and Janecek, 1990 ) and with some paleontological perspectives (e.g., Chaline, 1974 ). The more traditional notion of intercontinental dispersal and broad transcontinental distributions still receives stong support in the publications of Martin (1974 , 1987 ), Repenning (1980 , 1983 ), Repenning et al. (1990) , and van der Muelen (1978). Although we question Zagorodnyuk's cardinal reliance on chomosomal traits and do not wholly embrace his ranking of taxa (e.g., Neodon and Terricola as genera), his classification of Microtus and related forms deserves serious attention in future studies. See accounts of Blanfordimys, Chionomys, Lasiopodomys, and Proedromys, often included in Microtus but which are here treated as genera. North American forms revised by Bailey (1900) and taxonomy updated by Hall and Cockrum (1953) and Hall (1981) ; many aspects of paleontology, taxonomy, zoogeography, and anatomy covered in Tamarin (1985) .

COMMENTS: North American races revised, as L. trimucronatus , by Davis (1944) and retained as such by Hall and Cockrum (1953) and Hall and Kelson (1959) . Rausch (1953) proposed the synonymy of trimucronatus and nigripes under Old World L. sibiricus , a taxonomic arrangement elaborated by Rausch and Rausch (19751?) and maintained in subsequent faunal works ( Banfield, 1974 ; Hall, 1981 ; Jones et al., 1986 ). Gileva (1983) and Gileva et al. (1984) believed that the cytogenetic peculiarities of chrysogaster confirm its independence as a species relative to L. amurensis , L. lemmus , and L. sibiricus , and suggested it may be conspecific with North American L. trimucronatus . The sample they identified as chrysogaster , however, comes from the Chukotski Peninsula on the coast of the East Siberian Sea, not from the west coast of the Okhotsk Sea, the type locality of chrysogaster . Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) retained, with reservation, chrysogaster in the synonymy of L. sibiricus pending further study and accurate identification of lemmings from the Chukotski Peninsula. Corbet and Hill (1991) continued to recognize the St. George Island form nigripes as a species.

Although regarded as conspecific with North American M. pennsylvanicus on morphological grounds ( Klimkiewicz, 1970 ), chomosomal differences led Vorontsov and Lyapunova (1986) to conclude that their similarities represented convergence, not phylogenetic alliance; instead they remarked upon possible closer relationship of M. agrestis to North American M. chrotorrhinus . Zagorodnyuk (1990) emphasized this evolutionary distance by placing M. pennsylvanicus in the subgenus Mynomes .

Neofiber True, 1884 . Science, 4:34 . TYPE SPECIES: Neofiber alleni True, 1884 . COMMENTS: A relictual form once more widespread in the eastern USA (see Frazier, 1977 , and Hibbard and Dalquest, 1973 ). Although sometimes placed with Ondatra in the tribe Ondatrini ( Chaline and Mein , 1979 ; Kretzoi, 1969 ; Repenning et al., 1990 ), a variety of morphological features conveys their very distant relationship ( Carleton, 1981 ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ), as does fossil evidence ( Martin, 1975 ; Zakrzewski, 1974 ). Alternatively, Neofiber either has been cited as Arvicolinae incertae sedis ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ) or affiliated with Arvicola and Microtus in a broadly-defined tribe Arvicolini ( Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ) .

Myopus Miller, 1910 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 52:497 . TYPE SPECIES: Myodes schisticolor Lilljeborg, 1844 . COMMENTS: Tribe Lemmini . Conventionally treated as a genus until Chaline (1972) regarded the differences in molar pattern between schisticolor and Lemmus to only reflect specific-level distinctions (also see Chaline and Mein , 1979 ; Chaline et al., 1989 ). Koenigswald and Martin (1984) also cited molar-pattern similarity for their allocation of Myopus to a subgenus of Lemmus . Niethammer and Henttonen (1982) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) , however, maintained the generic segregation of Myopus , as we do here. Lemmus and Myopus share certain dental resemblances, but they are readily distinguished by other features that have not been addressed in the context of assessing the interrelationship of forms comprising these genus-group taxa. In our opinion, the phenotypically restricted character set mustered from a paleontological perspective is insufficient to falsify the hypothesis that schisticolor represents a monophyletic group separate from species of Lemmus .

Phaulomys Thomas, 1905 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 15:493 . TYPE SPECIES: Evotomys smithii Thomas, 1905 . COMMENTS: Originally described as a subgenus of Evotomys (= Clethrionomys ) and included in Eothenomys by most workers ( Aimi, 1980 ; Corbet, 1978c ). Kawamura (1988) , however, reinstated Phaulomys as a genus containing the two species listed below. Although the extant species have rootless molars, they can be derived through a transitional series of late Pleistocene samples from the middle Pleistocene Clethrionomys japonicus , which has molars with definite roots. Study of the variation in molar and external traits among species of Eothenomys and Anteliomys also led Tanaka (1971) to recognize Phaulomys as a genus distinct from Eothenomys. Chromosomal analyses of smithii suggest that Clethrionomys and Phaulomys have been derived from a common ancestor ( Ando et al., 1988 ). The removal of Japanese Phaulomys from Eothenomys, whose species-diversity centers in the mountains of China , and its proposed association with Clethrionomys is zoogeographically plausible and outlines a precise hypothesis that can be tested by analyses of other data sets. Aimi (1980) retraced the complex taxonomic history of species allocated to either Evotomys, Clethrionomys, Anteliomys, Phaulomys, or Eothenomys.
Ondatra Link, 1795 . Beytrage zur Naturgeschichte, 1 (2):76 . TYPE SPECIES: Castor zibethicus Linnaeus, 1766 . SYNONYMS: Fiber , Moschomys , Simotes . COMMENTS: Tribe Ondatrini , either as sole member ( Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ) or with Neofiber ( Chaline and Mein , 1979 ; Kretzoi, 1969 ; Repenning et al., 1990 ). Evidence from fossil history and morphology suggests that the two genera of "muskrats" are more distantly related than their inclusion in the same tribe would connote ( Carleton, 1981 ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ; L.

SYNONYMS: caspicus, epiroticus, ghalgai, mutilisi, relictus, rhodopensis, subarvalis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Microtus , arvalis species group. This is the species (with 2N=54, FN=56) that was listed as M. subarvalis or epiroticus by Corbet (1978c , 1984 ) and reviewed under the latter name by Petrov and Ruzic (1982) . Cytological and morphological comparisons to M. arvalis and M. obscurus underscore the specific distinctness of M. rossiaemeridionalis ( Gavrila et al., 1986 ; Krâl et al., 1981 ; Kratochvil, 1982b ; Naumova et al., 1990 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1991a , b; Zima et al., 1991 ). The geographic ranges of A4, arvalis and A4, rossiaemeridionalis broadly overlap (see Zagorodnyuk, 1991b:30 ). The record (as epiroticus) from Svalbard is documented by Fredga et al. (1990) , who suggested that the voles were introduced.

Lumped under Pitymys subterraneus by Ellerman Morrison-Scott (1951), but its validity as a separate species has been documented by Kratochvil (1970) and Kratochvil and Kràl (1974) and is so listed in faunal catalogues ( Corbet, 1978c ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ). The name kaznakovi may be valid for this species ( Corbet, 1984 ), but Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) avoided its use and cited Gromov and Polyakov (1977) for the opinion that it belongs with Alticola .

COMMENTS: Subgenus Mynomes , pennsylvanicus species group sensu Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Proposed as conspecific with Old World M. agrestis by Klimkiewicz (1970) , but Gbanded chromosomal differences support their recognition as distinct species ( Modi, 1987 ; Vorontsov and Lyapunova, 1986 ). Aside from the probable insular derivative M. breweri (see above account), pennsylvanicus may be closely related to M. montanus and M. townsendii among New World species (see Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Modi, 1987 ; Moore and Janecek, 1990 ). Regional studies of variation undertaken (e.g., Anderson, 1956 ; Anderson and Hubbard, 1971 ; Weddle and Choate, 1983 ), but comprehensive review of entire species warranted. Insular form provectus relegated to subspecific status by Chamberlain (1954) and Moyer et al. (1988) and nesophilus by Jones et al. (1986) . See Reich (1981 , Mammalian Species, 159).
Microtus oregoni (Bachman, 1839) . J. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 8:60 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Oregon , Clatsop Co., Astoria . DISTRIBUTION: Moist coniferous forest seres of Pacific Northwest, from SW British Columbia , Canada , south to NW California , USA . SYNONYMS: adocetus, bairdi , cantwelli, morosus , serpens . COMMENTS: Subgenus Mynomes , sole member of oregoni species group sensu Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Type species of Chilotus , conventionally recognized as a subgenus of Microtus (see Anderson, 1959 , 1960 ; Bailey, 1900 ), and occasionally including Old World M. socialis as a comember ( Chaline, 1974 ; Ognev, 1964 ) or not ( Anderson, 1959 ). Hooper and Hart (1962) , however, found the morphological evidence insufficient to warrant subgeneric segregation of oregoni from North American species of Microtus , a viewpoint sustained by genetic distance comparisons ( Moore and Janecek, 1990 ) and reflected in the classification of Zagorodnyuk (1990) . Diploid number and sexdetermining mechanism unique among North American Microtus studied ( Ohno et al., 1963 ). See Carraway and Verts, 1985 (Mammalian Species, 233).
Microtus pinetorum (Le Conte, 1830) . Ann. Lyc. Nat. Hist., 3:133 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Georgia , Liberty Co., old LeConte plantation near Riceboro (as interpreted by Bailey, 1900:63 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Temperate deciduous forest zone of E USA : eastern shoreline from S Maine to N Florida, west to C Wisconsin and E Texas . SYNONYMS: auricularis , carbonarius, kennicottii , nemoralis , parvulus , scalopsoides , schmidti . COMMENTS: Type species of Pitymys (see remarks under genus for variable treatment of this taxon). Van der Meulen (1978) regarded nemoralis and parvulus as species distinct from pinetorum in the genus Pitymys , as did Repenning (1983) for nemoralis . Their conclusions have yet to be critically examined with a broader array of information bases, although limited chromosomal and genetic surveys promise future insight ( Moore and Janecek, 1990 ; J. W. Wilson, 1984). See Smolen (1981 , Mammalian Species, 147).
Microtus quasiater (Coues, 1874) . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 26:191 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mexico , Veracruz , Jalapa . DISTRIBUTION: SE San Luis Potosi to N Oaxaca , Mexico . COMMENTS: Subgenus Pitymys . Named as a variety of M. pinetorum but specific status affirmed thereafter ( Bailey, 1900 ; Hall and Cockrum, 1953 ; Repenning, 1983 ). Typically viewed as most closely related to pinetorum in subgenus or genus Pitymys ( Anderson, 1960 ; Hall and Cockrum, 1953 ; van der Meulen, 1978 ), a convention challenged by Repenning (1983) and Moore and Janecek (1990) , who supported sister-group kinship between ochrogaster and quasiater .
Microtus richardsoni (DeKay, 1842) . Zoology of New York , Part I, Mammals, p. 91 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canada , Alberta Prov. , vicinity of Jasper House (as interpreted by Bailey, 1900:60 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Subalpine and alpine meadows of Rocky Mountains, from S British Columbia and Alberta , Canada , to W Wyoming and C Utah , USA ; and of Cascade Mountains, from SW British Columbia south through WC Oregon . SYNONYMS: arvicoloides , macropus , myllodontus, principalis . COMMENTS: Senior synonym of the type (= arvicoloides ) of Aulacomys . In early classifications ( Bailey, 1900 ; Miller, 1896 ), richardsoni was placed with Old World water voles of the subgenus Arvicola (including Aulacomys ) of Microtus , a relationship reaffirmed by Hooper and Hart (1962) and followed by others, with Arvicola employed either at the subgeneric ( Hall, 1981 ) or generic level (Jones et al., 1975). Other evidence favors the retention of richardsoni within Microtus and the restriction of Arvicola to Old World forms ( Carleton, 1981 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hinton, 1926; Koenigswald, 1980 ; Repenning, 1980 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). Hoffmann and Koeppel (1985) further suggested the de novo origin of M. richardsoni in North America from an early stock that also gave rise to M. xanthognathus , an idea consistent with the biochemical similarity of richardsoni to certain New World Microtus ( Nadler et al., 1978 ) and with Zagorodnyuk's (1990) expanded concept of the subgenus Aulacomys (including M. chrotorrhinus , M. longicaudus , and M. xanthognathus ). The phylogenetic placement of richardsoni in Arvicola versus Microtus bears critically on interpretations of historical zoogeography, but the appropriate sampling of New and Old World species needed to resolve the problem has yet to be achieved within a single study. See Ludwig (1984 , Mammalian Species, 223).

Corbet (1978c , and references therein) viewed liechtensteini as a separate species, but Krapp (1982b) included it in M. multiplex . Two distinctive karyotypes exist, one with 2N=48 ( multiplex ) and the other with 2N=46 ( liechtensteini ), but there is a record of hybridization ( Zima and Krâl, 1984a ). Tarsal glands compared (as liechtensteini ) with those of M. subterraneus by Hrabe (1977) .

COMMENTS: Classically treated as a member of the subgenus Stenocranius , related to Old World M. gregalis and synonymized with same by Rausch (1964) and Rausch and Rausch (1968) . Other data clearly support their specific distinctiveness (see Anderson, 1960 ; Fedyk, 1970 ; Vorontsov and Lyapunova, 1986 ). Zagorodnyuk (1990) further emphasized the distant kinship of M. gregalis and M. miurus by placing them in different subgenera, allying miurus with certain Old World species of the subgenus Alexandromys .

Geographic variation and subspecific classification assessed by Anderson (1959) , who viewed M. oeconomus as its sister species. Hooper and Hart (1962) arranged M. montanus with M. pennsylvanicus and M. townsendii , a general relationship corroborated by karyotypic and genic analyses ( Modi, 1987 ; Moore and Janecek, 1990 ).

COMMENTS: Subgenus Pallasiinus , oeconomus species group, including M. montebelli and M. limnophilus ( Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ) . Conspecific stature of Old and New World populations averred by Zimmermann (1942) and sustained by subsequent studies ( Nadler et al., 1976 , 1978; Ognev, 1964 ; Rausch, 1953 ). Geographic variation and subspecies of Nearctic populations reviewed by Paradiso and Manville (1961) ; Russian populations by Gromov and Polyakov (1977) ; European populations by Tast (1982b) . Chromosomal data is summarized and evaluated by Zima and Krâl (1984a) . Ecological and distributional details of the species at its southern limit in Poland are described by Salata-Pilacinska (1990) . Angermann (1984) analysed intraspecific molar patterns in the context of assessing the range of variation against which patterns in extinct species could be tested. Ognev (1964) , but not Corbet (1978c) , identified ratticeps Keyserling and Blasius, 1841 , as the proper name applicable to this species (also see discussions in Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:705 ; and Hall, 1981:805 ). Although systematists continue to utilize oeconomus Pallas, 1776 , for reasons of familiarity, this nomenclatural uncertainty needs formal resolution.

Microtus ochrogaster (Wagner, 1842) . In Schreber, Die Säugethiere, Suppl. 3:592 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Indiana , Posey Co., New Harmony (as fixed by Bole and Moulthrop, 1942:157 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Northern and Central Great Plains: EC Alberta to S Manitoba , Canada , south to N Oklahoma and Arkansas , eastwards to C Tennessee and westernmost West Virginia , USA ; relictual populations in C Colorado , N New Mexico , and coastal prairies of SW Louisiana and adjacent Texas , USA . SYNONYMS: austerus , cinnamonea , haydenii , ludovicianus , minor , ohioensis , similis , taylori . COMMENTS: A member of Pedomys , a taxon used as a subgenus of Microtus ( Bailey, 1900 ; van der Meulen, 1978 ), as a full synonym of Microtus ( Hall, 1981 ) , or as a synonym of Pitymys , whether the latter is used as a genus ( Repenning, 1983 ) or subgenus ( Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). The purported close affinity of M. ochrogaster with North American species of Pitymys has received little support from biochemical studies ( Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Moore and Janacek, 1990 ). Geographic variation over the Central Great Plains studied by Choate and Williams (1978) . The strong morphometric segregation of minor from other M. ochrogaster advises renewed scrutiny of its status ( Severinghaus, 1977 ). Includes ludovicianus, an isolated form of the coastal praires formerly consided a separate species and now apparently extinct (see Lowery, 1974 ). See Stalling (1990 , Mammalian Species, 355).

Clethrionomys Tilesius, 1850 . Isis, 2:28 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus rutilus Pallas, 1779 . SYNONYMS: Craseomys , Glareontys , Eotomys , Euotomys , Evotontys , Neoaschizontys. COMMENTS: Placed in tribe Clethrionomyini , usually with voles such as Eothenomys , Alticola , and Hyperacrius ( Koenigswald, 1980 ; Kretzoi, 1969 ). Clethrionontys is perhaps most closely related to Eothenomys , if not congeneric with it as suggested by some authors ( Corbet, 1978c , 1984; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ). Large segments of the genus were taxonomically reviewed by Aimi (1980) , Corbet (1978c , 1984 ), and Gromov and Polyakov (1977) ; chromosomal data summarized and interspecific relationships discussed by Gamperl (1982) , Modi and Gamperl (1989) , Nadler et al. (1976) ; Sokolov et al. (1990), and Vorontsov et al. (1978) ; electrophoretic data presented by Nadler et al. (1978) and Chaline and Graf (1988) . The relationship among European and Japanese species based on living and Pleistocene samples was monographed by Kawamura (1988) . Species in this genus were commonly listed under Evotomys (e.g., Hinton, 1926) until Palmer (1928) established the priority of Clethrionomys . Recently, Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) have questioned whether Myodes is a senior synonym of Clethrionomys and Zagorodnyuk (1990) employed the former name. This issue warrants prompt settlement before the literature on red-backed voles is diffused under yet another generic name.
Chionomys gud (Satunin, 1909) . Izv. Kavkas. Mus., 4:272 . TYPE LOCALITY: Georgia , Caucasus, Gudauri, S of Krestovyi Pass . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Caucasus Mtns, and NE Turkey . SYNONYMS: gotschobi, ighesicus, lasistanius, lucidus, neujukovi, oseticus. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Corbet (1978c) . Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c) listed gotschobi and ighesicus as synonyms of nivalis , but Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) included them in C. gud .
Chionomys nivalis (Martins, 1842) . Rev. Zool. Paris, p. 331 . TYPE LOCALITY: Switzerland , Berner Oberland, Faulhorn . DISTRIBUTION: Mountains of Europe from Spain through the Alps to Tatra, the Carpathians, Balkans, Mt Olympus and Pindus Range, east to W Caucasus, Turkey , Israel , Lebanon , Syria , Transcaucasia, Kopet Dag, and Zagros Mtns of Iran (see Krapp, 1982«, for European range and Harrison and Bates, 1991 , for Middle East). Records in Greece were provided by Niethammer (1987b) . SYNONYMS: abulensis, aleco, alpinus , aquitanius, cedrorum, dementievi, herntonis, lebrunii , leucurus (of Gerbe, 1852, not Blyth, 1863), loginovi, ntalyi, mirhanreini , nivicola , olympius, petrophilus , pontius , radnensis , satunini, spitzenbergerae, trialeticus, ulpius , wagneri. COMMENTS: European populations reviewed by Krapp (1982a) . Intraspecific morphological variation among Carpathian samples were analyzed by Kratochvil (1981) along with a review of European and Turkish subspecies. The subspecies spitzenbergerae denotes a population from S Turkey that was previously identified as C. gud ( Nadachowski, 1990b ) , a species which is known only from NE Turkey where it is sympatric with C. nivalis . Analyses of vertical distribution of C. nivalis in Yugoslavia ( Krystufek and Kovacic, 1989 ) and geographic variation among samples from Austria and Yugoslavia ( Krystufek, 1990 ) amplify knowledge of morphological variation within the species. Chromosomal variation in Bulgarian populations was reported by Peshev and Belcheva (1979) . Allozyme variation and differentiation among samples of C. nivalis from N Italy and Israel were reported by Filippucci et al. (1991) , who also noted that the Israeli population from Mt. Hermon (herntonis) might represent a separate species.
Chionomys roberti (Thomas, 1906) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:418 . TYPE LOCALITY: Turkey , Pontus Prov., Sumila, 30 mi S Trebizond (= Trabzon ) .

COMMENTS: European populations reviewed by Viro and Niethammer (1982) . Analysis of evolutionary relationships among British samples was reported by Steven (1953) , biochemical differentiation among populations over short geographic distances was presented by Leitner and Hartl (1988) . Evolutionary significance in morphology of third upper molar in extant and fossil samples analyzed by Bauchau and Chaline (1987) .
Clethrionomys californiens (Merriam, 1890) . N. Am. Fauna, 4:26 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , California , Humboldt Co., Eureka . DISTRIBUTION: Pacific-coast coniferous forest from the Columbia River south through W Oregon to NW California , USA . SYNONYMS: mazama , obscurus . COMMENTS: The name occidentalis was formerly applied to this species (e.g., Hall and Cockrum, 1953 ), but populations north of the Columbia River , which include occidentalis and caurinus , have been reassigned to C. gapperi ( Cowan and Guiguet, 1965 ; Johnson and Ostenson, 1959 ).
Clethrionomys centralis Miller, 1906 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 17:373 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kazakhstan , W Tien Shan Mtns, Koksu valley, 9000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Tien Shan Mtns, Kazakhstan and Kirghizia ; and adjacent Xinjiang , China . SYNONYMS: frater . COMMENTS: A distinctive species recognized as such by Hinton (1926), included in C. glareolus by Corbet (1978c) , and recognized again as separate ( Corbet, 1984 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ). Some Russian ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ) and Chinese ( Ma et al., 1987 ) workers still use frater for the species. Chromosomal data recorded by Vorontsov et al. (1978) and Sokolov et al. (1990).
Clethrionomys gapperi (Vigors, 1830) . Zool. J., 5:204 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canada , Ontario , between York (= Toronto) and Lake Simcoe . DISTRIBUTION: Most of Canada from N British Columbia to Labrador, excluding Newfoundland; south in the Appalachians to N Georgia , in the Great Plains to N Iowa , and in the Rockies to C New Mexico and EC Arizona , USA . SYNONYMS: arizonensis , athabascae, brevicaudus , carolinensis , cascadensis, caurinus , fuscodorsalis , galei , gaspeanus, gauti, hudsonius , idahoensis , limitis , loringi , maurus , nivarius , occidentalis , ochraceus , pallescens, paludicola , phaeus , proteus , pygmaeus , rhoadsii, rufescens , rupicola , saturatus , solus , stikinensis, uintaensis, ungava , wrangeli . COMMENTS: Information on specific relationships somewhat contradictory. Interspecific hybrids of reduced fertility produced from laboratory crosses with Eurasian C. glareolus , which led Grant (1974) to view the two as semispecies of recent divergence. Others ( Bee and Hall, 1956 ; Youngman, 1975 ) have suggested, without presentation of data, that gapperi and rutilus are conspecific. Based on biochemical data, Nadler et al. (1978) viewed Old World C. rufocanus as closely related to the gapperi-rutilus complex. Most highly variable in gastric morphology among species of Clethrionomys studied by Carleton (1981) . See account of C. californiens for allocation of occidentalis and caurinus to C. gapperi . See Merritt (1981 , Mammalian Species, 146).

COMMENTS: European populations are reviewed by Reichstein (1982b) and northern Spanish samples by Ventura and Gosalbez (1989). Morphometric analyses contrasting two subspecies in Netherlands reported by Warmerdam (1982) . Morphological variability in context of taxonomic and distributional studies provided by Kratochvll (1980, 1983), Krystufek and Tvrtkovic (1984) , Nikolaeva (1982) , and Ventura (1991) . More than one species is represented in this complex (see generic comments).
Arvicola sapidus Miller, 1908 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 1:195 . TYPE LOCALITY: Spain , Burgos Prov., Santo Domingo de Silos . DISTRIBUTION: Portugal , Spain , and W France (see map in Reichstein, 1982a:214 ). SYNONYMS: musiniani , tenebricus .

Arborimus longicaudus (True, 1890) . Proc. U. S. Natl. Mus., 13:303 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Oregon , Coos Co., Marshfield . DISTRIBUTION: Pacific coast of W Oregon , north of Klamath Mtns, USA . SYNONYMS: silvicola. COMMENTS: Although Howell (1926b) recognized silvicola as a nominal species, subsequent research has favored its synonymy under A. longicaudus ( Johnson, 1968 ) , where it has been maintained as a subspecies ( Hall, 1981 ; Johnson and George, 1991 ). Formerly included populations in California assigned to the new species A. porno (see next account).
Arborimus porno Johnson and George, 1991 . Los Angeles Co. Nat. Hist. Mus., Contr. Sci., 429:12 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , California , Sonoma Co., 0.8 km N Jenner, Jenner Ridge; 38°27'N , 123°06'W . DISTRIBUTION: Coastal coniferous forest of NW California , south of Klamath Mtns as far as Sonoma Co., USA . COMMENTS: Closely related to A. longicaudus (see Johnson and George, 1991 ).
Arvicola Lacepede, 1799 . Tab. Div. Subd. Orders Genres Mammifères, p. 10 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus amphibius Linnaeus, 1758 (= Mus terrestris Linnaeus, 1758 ). SYNONYMS: Alviceola , Hemiotomys , Ochetomys , Paludicola , Praticola . COMMENTS: Excludes the North American Microtus richardsoni (see account of that species), which was placed in Arvicola by Hooper and Hart (1962) . Generic reviews were provided by Corbet (1978c , 1984 ) and Gromov and Polyakov (1977) , who recognized only two extant species, A. sapidus and A. terrestris . Earlier, Miller (1912a) defined seven species ( amphibius , illyricus, italicus, musignani , sapidus , scherman , and terrestris ) and Hinton (1926) recognized four ( amphibius , sapidus , scherman , and terrestris ). We follow Corbet's (1978c) unsatisfactory arrangement pending careful systematic revision of the genus, which will likely reflect a classification more similar to that of Hinton (1926). Arvicola is phylogenetically close to Microtus ( Burgos et al., 1989 ; Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Graf, 1982 ). Heinrich (1990) hypothesized that it evolved from the extinct Mimomys , a view already presented by Hinton (1926), and Rekovets (1990) summarized the fossil history leading to the modern groups of Arvicola .
Chionomys Miller, 1908 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 1:97 . TYPE SPECIES: Arvicola nivalis Martins, 1842 . COMMENTS: Tribe Arvicolini . Although described as a genus, Miller (1912a) later employed Chionomys as a subgenus, a status which became entrenched in the literature ( Corbet, 1978c , Krapp, 1982a ) with rare dissenters (e.g., Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Lehmann, 1969 ). Recent analyses reveal that Chionomys is not part of the monophyletic group containing Microtus ( Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Graf, 1982 ; Nadachowski, 1990«; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). Van der Meulen (1978) considered Suranontys to be a junior synonym of Chionontys, but the type species of Suranontys (= Microtus malei ) is regarded as a Microtus related to the oeconomus group, not to Chionontys (see Nadachowski, 1990«). New World Microtus longicaudus was referred to Chionontys by Anderson (1960) , but a variety of data sources allies the former with Microtus proper ( Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Graf, 1982 ). Discussing the origin and phylogeny of Chionontys, Nadachowski (1990«, 1991) suggested that two branches developed in Europe, one leading to C. nivalis , the other to C. roberti and C. gud . All three species are sympatric in the Caucasus (Nadachowski, 1990«). Karyotypic variation among the three species is reported by Sablina (1988) and Zima and Krâl (1984a) .
Blanfordimys bucharicus (Vinogradov, 1930) . Rukovodstvok opredeleniyu gryzunov Srednei Azii [Key to Determine Rodents of Central Asia], p. 45 . TYPE LOCALITY: Tadzhikistan , Zeravshan Range, 8 km S Pendzhikent, near village of Zivan, 2200 m . DISTRIBUTION: Mtns of SW Tadzhikistan , possibly N Afghanistan ; limits unresolved. SYNONYMS: davydovi. COMMENTS: Usually included in afghanus ( Corbet, 1978c ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Ognev, 1964 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ), but morphometric and karyologic analyses indicate that bucharicus is a separate species with two distinct geographic components, one newly described as the subspecies davydovi ( Golenishchev and Sablina, 1991 ).
Blanfordimys afghanus (Thomas, 1912) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 9:349 . TYPE LOCALITY: Afghanistan , Badkhiz, Gulran . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from high steppes and semi-desert in S Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , Tadzhikistan , and Afghanistan ; isolated population in Great Balkhan Mtns on E coast of Caspian Sea (see Golenishchev and Sablina, 1991 ; Hassinger, 1973 ; Niethammer, 1970 ). SYNONYMS: balchanensis, dangarinensis. COMMENTS: Taxonomy and distribution of Afghanistan populations reported by Niethammer (1970) and Hassinger (1973) ; morphometric and karyological analyses provided by Golenishchev and Sablina (1991) , who recognized three subspecies.
Blanfordimys Argyropulo, 1933 . Z. Säugetierk., 8:182 . TYPE SPECIES: Microtus bucharicus Vinogradov, 1930 . COMMENTS: Originally proposed as a subgenus of Microtus , a ranking traditionally acknowledged by Russian authors ( Golenishchev and Sablina, 1991 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Ognev, 1964 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ). In other taxonomic variations, Corbet (1978c) assigned afghanus , the type-species of Blanfordimys , to the genus Pitymys , and Chaline (1974) placed it in Neodon , subgenus Microtus . Ellerman (1941) considered the diagnostic traits of afghanus so impressive that he recognized the genus, as did Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and recently Zagorodnyuk (1990) . We concur. Blanfordimys is defined by derived features that set it apart from other voles. Furthermore, the significance of these features has never been adequately assessed in the context of a careful phylogenetic study involving the many subgenera now included in Microtus and other genera considered to be closely related to it. Isolating Blanfordimys from Microtus defines an explicit hypothesis of relationships that should be critically tested with morphological, chromosomal, and biochemical data.
Alticola barakshin Bannikov, 1947 . Bull. Moscow Soc. Nat., Biol., 52, 4:217 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mongolia , Gobi Altai Mtns, Gurvan Saikhan Ridge, Dzun Saikhan . DISTRIBUTION: From Tuva region in Russia east through W and S Mongolia ; probably occurs in adjoining Chinese regions (see Rossolimo et al., 1988 ). COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Included in A. stoliczkanus by Corbet (1978c) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) , but revised as a separate species by Rossolimo et al. (1988) . Chromosomal data provided by Yatsenko (1980).
Alticola roylei Gray, 1842 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 10:265 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Kumaon . DISTRIBUTION: W Himalayas; recorded only from N Kumaon and N Himachal Pradesh (Lahul region) of N India . SYNONYMS: cautus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Once considered the broadest-ranging species of Alticola in central Asia ( Corbet, 1978c ), but with the removal of argentatus and its synonyms ( Rossolimo, 1989 ), the geographic and morphological definition of roylei conforms to that presented by Hinton (1926).
Alticola lemminus (Miller, 1898) . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 1898:369 . TYPE LOCALITY: Siberia, Bering Strait, Plover Bay , Kelsey Station . DISTRIBUTION: NE Siberia from Chukotka area west through the Anadyr region to mouth of River Lena, and south throughout the Lena basin. COMMENTS: Subgenus Aschizomys . Corbet (1978c) transferred the species to Eothenomys , but Russian workers refered lemminus to Alticola ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Ognev, 1964 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ). Earlier, Hinton (1926:279) recognized Aschizomys but speculated that the species "will prove to be a member of the E. rufocanus group." Miller (1940a:94) reexamined the holotype and identified it as "nothing more than an alcohol-discolored specimen of the extreme East Asian representative of Clethrionomys rufocanus." Based on our inspection of the holotype of lemminus, we endorse Ognev's (1964) allocation to Alticola, subgenus Aschizomys, and are impressed by its diagnostic features. Significant chromosomal and morphological differences between samples of A. lemminus from Chukotka and Yakutia regions led Bykova et al. (1978) to speculate that “lemminus" may be a composite of two species.
Alticola macrotis Radde, 1862 . Reise in den Süden von Ost-Sibierien, 1:196 . TYPE LOCALITY: Siberia, S Krasnoyarsk Krai , E Sayan Mtns . DISTRIBUTION: From Altai (Siberia and Xinjiang) and Sayan Mtns east and northeast through N Mongolia and Lake Baikal region to Region of Olekminski in Yakutsk, Russia . SYNONYMS: altaica , fetisovi, vicina, vinogradovi . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Ognev (1964) placed this species in the subgenus Alticola , but Gromov and Polyakov (1977) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) listed it under the subgenus Aschizomys . We follow Ognev until the phylogenetic position of lemminus , the type-species of Aschizomys , is defined relative to species of Alticola .
Alticola montosa (True, 1894) . Proc. U. S. Natl. Mus., 17:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , central Kashmir, 11,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from Kashmir, 8000 to 13,000 ft (Hinton, 1926). SYNONYMS: imitator . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Usually incorporated in A. roylei ( Corbet, 1978c ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ), but the diagnostic traits of montosa clearly distinguish it from the geographically adjacent roylei , as Hinton (1926) long ago noted.
Alticola semicanus (Allen, 1924) . Am. Mus. Novit., 133:6 . TYPE LOCALITY: Mongolia , Khangai Mtns, upper flow of Ongyin Gol River "Sain Noin Khan." DISTRIBUTION: From the Tuva region of Russia throughout N Mongolia (see Rossolimo et al., 1988 ). SYNONYMS: alleni . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Originally described as a subspecies of Microtus worthingtoni , later synonymized with Alticola roylei ( Corbet, 1978c ) , eventually listed as a separate species ( Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ), and finally taxonomically revised ( Rossolimo et al., 1988 ).
Alticola stoliczkanus (Blanford, 1875) . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 44:107 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , N Ladakh, Kuenlun Mtns . DISTRIBUTION: From N Ladakh and Nepal through W and N Xizang , Tibet , to Gansu in N China ; range limits unknown. SYNONYMS: acrophilus , lama , nanschanicus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Geographic range is allopatric to that of A. stracheyi ( Feng et al., 1986 ) , with which it was once united.
Alticola strelzowi (Kastchenko, 1899) . Izv. Imp. Tomsk . Univ., 16:50 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Altai Krai , Altai Mtns, near Lake Teniga . DISTRIBUTION: From the Altai Mtns of NW Mongolia, Siberia, and Xinjiang in NW China ( Ma et al., 1987 ) west through Kazakhstan to Karaganda region. SYNONYMS: depressus , desertorum . COMMENTS: Subgenus Platycranius . Citations and synonyms are discussed by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) .
Alticola stracheyi Thomas, 1880 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 5, 6:332 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Kashmir, Ladakh (as amended by Hinton, 1926:322) . DISTRIBUTION: Himalayas from E Kashmir in N India east through S Xizang (Tibet) and N Nepal to N Sikkim. SYNONYMS: cricetulus , bhatnagari. COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Included in A. stoliczkanus by Schwarz (1939) , Gromov and Polyakov (1977) and Corbet (1978c) , but reinstated as a species by Feng et al. (1986) , which reflects Hinton's (1926) earlier arrangement.
Alticola tuvinicus Ognev, 1950 . [ Mammals of USSR and Adjacent Countries], 7:520 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , Tuvinskaya ( Tuva ), Kyzyl Mozhalyk . DISTRIBUTION: The Altai Mtns and Tuva region , N Khubsugul Lake Valley, S Bailkal Lake Valley, and and nearby regions in NW Mongolia (see Rossolimo et al., 1988 ). SYNONYMS: baicalensis, khubsugulensis, kosogol, olchonensis . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Originally described as a species and then synonymized under the ubiquitous A. roylei . Listed as a separate species by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) and revised by Rossolimo et al. (1988) , who recognized kosogol and olchonensis as subspecies. Gromov and Polyakov (1977) considered olchonensis closely related to A. macrotis ; its status needs to be reassessed.
Arborimus Taylor, 1915 . Proc. California Acad. Sci., ser. 4, 5:119 . TYPE SPECIES: Phenacomys longicaudus True, 1890 . SYNONYMS: Paraphenacomys . COMMENTS: Described as a subgenus of Phenacomys and conventionally recognized as such or as a complete synonym ( Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; Hall, 1981 ; Howell, 1926b ). Evidence for generic stature marshalled by Johnson (1968 , 1973). Nonetheless, whether Arborimus is most closely related to Phenacomys or to some other arvicoline has not been substantiated with broad taxonomic sampling that includes critical species like albipes . Specific and subspecific classification basically set forth by Howell (1926b) and Hall and Cockrum (1953) , as part of Phenacomys , and by Johnson and George (1991) .
Arborimus albipes (Merriam, 1901) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 14: 125 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , California , Humboldt Co., Humboldt Bay, redwood forest near Arcata . DISTRIBUTION: Pacific coastal zone south of Columbia River, from W Oregon to extreme NW California , USA . COMMENTS: More generalized terrestrial form and habits have suggested a closer relationship to Phenacomys intermedius (e.g., Hall, 1981 , placed albipes and intermedius together in subgenus Phenacomys ). Johnson and Maser (1982) enumerated character states that instead support closer congruence of albipes with species of Arborimus . However, see Repenning and Grady (1988) , who diagnosed the subgenus Paraphenacomys of Phenacomys to contain albipes , which they viewed as more distantly related to the sister species intermedius and longicaudus .
Subfamily Arvicolinae Gray, 1821 . London Med. Repos., 15:303 . SYNONYMS: Alticoli, Bramini, Clethrionomyini , Dicrostonychinae, Ellobiini , Fibrini, Lagurini , Lemminae, Microtinae, Microtoscoptini, Myodini, Neofibrini, Ondatrini , Phenacomyini , Pitymyini, Pliomyini, Pliophenacomyini, Prometheomyinae , Synaptomyini. COMMENTS: See Kretzoi (1962 , 1969 ) for use of Arvicolinae Gray, 1821 , instead of Microtinae Miller, 1896 ; a group concept of arvicoline rodents actually had emerged long prior to Miller's (1896) seminal monograph (e.g., Murray, 1866 ; Alston, 1876 ). Carleton and Musser (1984) provided a general diagnosis and review of the limits and contents of the subfamily. Synthetic regional taxonomic treatments include: Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , Corbet (1978c , 1984 ), and Agadzhanyan and Yatsenko (1984) for Palaearctic species; Ognev (1963b , 1964 ), Gromov and Polyakov (1977) , and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) for Asian forms; Niethammer and Krapp (1982a) for European species; and Hall and Cockrum (1953) and Hall (1981) for North American voles and lemmings. Biochronology of arvicolines in the northern hemisphere was comprehensively reviewed by Repenning et al. (1990) and Repenning (1990, and references therein). Broad, multispecies surveys have been undertaken on morphological and biochemical systems of arvicolines that bear on issues of their phenetic divergence and phylogenetic relationships. For example, comparative and functional studies of the dentition (Hinton, 1926; Koenigswald, 1980 , 1982 ; Miller, 1896 ); of the cranium ( Gromov, 1990 ; Kratochvil, 1982a ; Pietsch, 1980 ); of middle ear anatomy ( Hooper, 1968a ; Pavlinov, 1984); of cutaneous and subcutaneous glands ( Quay, 1954a , 1968; Sokolov and Dzhemukhadze, 1991 ); of myology ( Kesner, 1980 , 1986 ; Repenning, 1968 ; Stein, 1986 , 1987 ); of the digestive tract ( Carleton, 1981 ; Quay, 1954b ; Vorontsov, 1979); and of reproductive structures ( Anderson, 1960 ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Niethammer, 1972 ). Molecular studies that address phylogenetic questions have assessed allozymic variation ( Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Gill et al., 1987 ; Graf, 1982 ; Moore and Janecek, 1990 ), DNA-DNA hybridization ( Catzeflis, 1990 ; Catzeflis et al., 1987 ), and chromosomal morphology and banding patterns ( Burgos et al., 1989 ; Modi, 1987 ; Radosavlievic et al., 1990 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 , 1991 c ; Zima and Krâl, 1984a ). The proliferation of family-group names, practically a one-to-one correspondence with recognized genera, does not necessarily connote unambiguous delineation of higher-order relationships—e.g., compare the tribal contents of Ognev (1963b) , Hooper and Hart (1962) , Kretzoi (1969) , Gromov and Polyakov (1977) , and Repenning et al.

COMMENTS: The scope of the Family Muridae employed herein is practically equivalent to the Superfamily Muroidea as classically arranged by Miller and Gidley (1918) , Simpson (1945) , and others (see Carleton, 1980 ; Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; and Hooper and Musser, 1964a ; for reviews of muroid classification). The chapter's organization generally follows that of Carleton and Musser (1984) , which serves as a convenient framework to discuss the generic-and specific-level diversity of muroids and their attendant taxonomic problems and uncertainties. It is not a higher-order classification of the family or superfamily. Family-group synonyms are listed under the various subfamilies. We have sought to present the 1326 species and 281 genera recognized within the dialogue of the original descriptive and primary revisionary literature, especially where differences of opinion exist over a taxon's rank and validity, rather than secondary and tertiary sources. In many instances, we have gone back to examine collections and type material in order to gain a better grasp of a taxonomic issue or to illuminate distributions; the holdings of the American Museum of Natural History, British Museum of Natural History, Field Museum of Natural History, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, National Museum of Natural History, and Senckenberg Museum were especially important in this regard. In reading the various generic and specific accounts, a clear message is repeated: much alpha taxonomic uncertainty and confusion persist within the Muridae , a situation which warrants very basic, museum-based revisionary attention.

Alticola argentatus (Severtzov, 1879) . Izv. Soc. Nat. Anthrop. Etnogr., 8, 2:82 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kazakhstan , Chimkentskaia Obi., Karatau Mtns, Mashat . DISTRIBUTION: Mountainous region from Xinjiang , NW China ( Ma et al., 1987 ), southwest through the Dzhungarski Alatau, the Talasskiy Alatau, the Tien Shan, Pamirs, and into the mountains of N Afghanistan , N Pakistan , and N India . SYNONYMS: alaica, argurus , blanfordi , gracilis , lahulis, leucura , longicauda , longicaudata, parvidens , phasma , rosanvi, saurica, shnitnikovi, severtzovi , subluteus, villosa , worthingtoni . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Included in A. roylei by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c) , but separated as a species by Rossolimo (1989) , who recognized blanfordi , phasma , severtzovi , subluteus, and worthingtoni as subspecies. Attribution of synonyms follows Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) .
Alticola albicauda (True, 1894) . Proc. U. S. Natl. Mus., 17: 12 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Baltistan, Braldu Valley . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from the Himalayan portions of Baltistan and Kashmir, NW India . SYNONYMS: acmaeus . COMMENTS: Subgenus Alticola . Although usually included in A. roylei ( Corbet, 1978c ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ), the diagnostic traits of albicauda that set it apart as a distinct species were earlier pointed out by Hinton (1926). Schwarz's (1939) acmaeus identifies a geographic variant of the same species.
Alticola Blanford, 1881 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 50:96 . TYPE SPECIES: Arvicola stoliczkanus Blanford, 1875 . SYNONYMS: Aschizomys, Platycranius . COMMENTS: Hinton's (1926) monograph remains one of the best overall reviews of the genus, as supplemented by the morphological studies of Rossolimo et al. (1988) and Rossolimo (1989) and the cytogenetic results of Hielscher et al. (1992) . Schwarz (1939) also reviewed the Himalayan species. We follow Gromov and Polyakov (1977) , along with Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) , in recognizing the subgenera Alticola , Aschizomys , and Platycranius. DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated that Alticola macrotis is a sister species of Clethrionomys rufocanus and that A. argentatus is phylogenetically closer to C. rutilus and C. glareolus than to A. macrotis ( Gileva et al., 1989 ). Alticola is broadly related to Clethrionomys, an affinity Hooper and Hart (1962) acknowledged by placing Alticola with Clethrionomys, Eothenomys, Hyperacrius, Dolomys , and Phenacomys in the tribe Clethrionomyini, a division also recognized by Gromov and Polyakov (1977) . Comparative study of appendicular myology and osteology reinforces the monophyly of Alticola and its close association with Clethrionomys and Eothenomys ( Stein, 1987 ).
Hyperacrius fertilis (True, 1894) . Proc. U. S. Natl. Mus., 17:10 . TYPE LOCALITY: India , Kashmir, Pir Panjal Mtns, 8500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Kashmir region and N Pakistan ( Corbet, 1978c ; Phillips, 1969 ). SYNONYMS: aitchisoni , brachelix , zygomaticus .
Lagurus lagurus (Pallas, 1773) . Reise Prov. Russ. Reichs., 2:704 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kazakhstan , mouth of Ural River . DISTRIBUTION: Steppes from Ukraine through N Kazakhstan to W Mongolia and NW China ( Xinjiang ) (see Corbet, 1978c ). SYNONYMS: abacanicus, agressus, altorum, migratorius , occidentalis , saturatus . COMMENTS: Chromosomal data summarized and reviewed by Zima and Krâl (1984a) .
Hyperacrius wynnei (Blanford, 1881) . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal,49:244 . TYPE LOCALITY: Pakistan , Murree, 7000 ft (locality of lectotype , as selected by Phillips, 1969 ) . DISTRIBUTION: N Pakistan , Murree Hills in the lower Kahgan Valley E of Indus River , and W of the Indus in Swat (see Phillips, 1969 ). SYNONYMS: traubi.
Lasiopodomys brandtii (Radde, 1861) . Melanges Biol. Acad. St. Petersbourg, 3:683 . TYPE LOCALITY: Russia , NE Mongolia, near Tarei-Nor . DISTRIBUTION: Mongolia and adjacent Transbaikalia, Russia , and the Chinese provinces of E Nei Mongol, Heilungkiang, Jilin, and Hebei. SYNONYMS: aga, hangaicus, warringtoni .
Lagurus Gloger, 1841 . Gemein Hand.-Hilfsbuch. Nat., 1:97 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus lagurus Pallas, 1773 . SYNONYMS: Eremiomys . COMMENTS: Closely related to Eolagurus , both of which are the only extant members of the Tribe Lagurini ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) clarified the status of Mus lagurus as the type species instead of L. migratorius as indicated by Corbet (1978c) . Excludes North American Lemmiscus curtatus (see that account).
Hyperacrius Miller, 1896 . N. Am. Fauna, 12:54 . TYPE SPECIES: Arvicola fertilis True, 1894 . COMMENTS: Taxonomy, geographic distribution, and ecology reviewed by Phillips (1969) . According to Corbet (1978c) , phylogenetically near Alticola but more fossorial, and assigned to Clethrionomyini by Hooper and Hart (1962) and Gromov and Polyakov (1977) .
Lasiopodomys Lataste, 1887 . Ann. Mus. Civ . Stor. Nat. Genova, 2a, 4:268 . TYPE SPECIES: Arvicola brandtii Radde, 1861 . COMMENTS: Although systematists agree that Lasiopodomys belongs in Arvicolini , they have disagreed over its generic status. Some have relegated it to a subgenus of Microtus (Allen, 1940; Corbet, 1978c ; Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ). However, Hinton (1926) noted the diagnostic features that sets Lasiopodomys apart as a genus, a ranking broadly acknowledged by both neontologists and paleontologists ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ; Repenning et al., 1990 ; Smorkacheva et al., 1990 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ; Zheng and Li, 1990 ). The allocation to Microtus has not issued from careful phylogenetic study; until data is obtained suggesting otherwise, Lasiopodomys should be retained as a genus.
Lasiopodomys fuscus (Büchner, 1889) . Wiss. Res. Przewalski Cent .-Asien Reisen, Zool., I:(Säuget.), p. 125 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Qinghai Prov. , "Dy-Tschju River (upper reaches of Yellow and Blue Rivers), approximately 34°N , 93°E " (as given by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951:682 ) . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded from Qinghai Prov. ; extent of range unresolved. COMMENTS: Included in Pitymys leucurus by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Corbet (1978c) , but separated as a species and placed in Lasiopodomys by Zheng and Wang (1980) .
Lasiopodomys mandarinus (Milne-Edwards, 1871) . Rech. Hist. Nat. Mammifères, p. 129 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Shanxi (Shansi), probably near Saratsi . DISTRIBUTION: C and NE China (Nei Mongolia , Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Heilongjiang); N Mongolia ; Transbaikal region and E and SE Siberia of Russia ; Korea ; limits of range uncertain. SYNONYMS: faeceus, jeholensis , johannes , kishidai , pullus , vinogradovi .
Lemmus amurensis Vinogradov, 1924 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 14:186 . TYPE LOCALITY: Siberia, Pikan, on River Zeya, a tributary of the Amur River . DISTRIBUTION: Larch taiga of E Siberia, from east of Lake Baikal through the upper Amur River basin, and north in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskogo Mtns to the River Omolon (see Chernyavskii et al., 1980). SYNONYMS: ognevi. COMMENTS: A distinctive species revised by Chernyavskii et al. (1980). Additional chromosomal data analyzed by Gileva et al. (1984) in context of distinguishing species of Lemmus .
Lemmiscus curtatus (Cope, 1868) . Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia , 20:2 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Nevada , Esmeralda Co., Mt. Magruder, Pigeon Spring . DISTRIBUTION: Sagebrush steppe and desert from S Alberta and SE Saskatchewan , Canada , south to NW Colorado and EC California , including the Columbia Basin of interior Oregon and Washington , USA . SYNONYMS: artemisiae, intermedius , levidensis, orbitus, pallidus , pauperrimus . COMMENTS: See Carroll and Genoways, 1980 (Mammalian Species, 124, as Lagurus curtatus ).
Lemmiscus Thomas, 1912 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 9:401 . TYPE SPECIES: Arvicola curtata Cope, 1868 . COMMENTS: Named as a subgenus of Lagurus to segregate New World sagebrush voles from Old World steppe voles. Davis (1939) underscored the morphological separation between New and Old World forms and raised Lemmiscus to a genus, a view supported by Carleton's (1981) study of gastric anatomy. Subsequent faunal studies and checklists have variously listed Lemmiscus as a genus ( Carleton and Musser, 1984 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ) or as a subgenus of Lagurus ( Hall, 1981 ; Honacki et al., 1982 ). Certain morphological traits associate Lemmiscus with Microtus ( Carleton, 1981 ; Davis, 1939 ), but chromosomal banding patterns provide little resolution of its phylogenetic affinity ( Modi, 1987 ).
Lemmus Link, 1795 . Beitr. Naturgesch., 1 (2):75 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus lemmus Linnaeus, 1758 . SYNONYMS: Brachyurus , Hypudaeus, Lemnus , Myodes . COMMENTS: Nominative genus of Miller's (1896) classic tribe Lemmi , then including Dicrostonyx (see that account). Distinctiveness still recognized as the tribe Lemmini , including Myopus and Synaptomys , a clade believed to represent an early line of arvicoline evolution ( Carleton, 1981 ; Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Graf, 1982 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hinton, 1926; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ). Fossil history reviewed by Koenigswald and Martin (1984) and zoogeography discussed by Rausch and Rausch (1975b) . Old World taxa reviewed by Corbet (1978c , 1984 ), Gromov and Polyakov (1977) , and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Chromosomal information summarized and reviewed by Zima and Krâl (1984a) . Also see account of Myopus .
Eothenomys custos (Thomas, 1912) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 8, 9:517 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Yunnan , Atuntsi, 11,500 -12,500 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from mtns of Sichuan and Yunnan , where it occurs up to 4200 m ( Corbet, 1978c ). SYNONYMS: hintoni, rubelius, rubellus. COMMENTS: Listed as a species of Anteliomys by Hinton (1926).
Ellobius tancrei Blasius, 1884 . Zool. Anz., 7:197 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kazakhstan , Zaissan Lake Valley, Kendyrlik (= Przevalskoie) . DISTRIBUTION: From NE Turkmenistan ( Yakimenko and Lyapunova, 1986 ) and Uzbekistan east through E Kazakhstan to E China ( Xinjiang and Nei Mongolia) and Mongol. SYNONYMS: coenosus , fusciceps, fuscipes , kastschenkoi , ognevi, ursulus. COMMENTS: Included in E. talpinus by Corbet (1978c) but now regarded as a distinct species whose geographic range is allopatric to that of E. talpinus (see references in Corbet, 1984 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ; Yakimenko and Lyapunova, 1986 ). Chromosomal contrasts with E. talpinus recorded by Yakimenko and Lyapunova (1986) , comparisons with E. alaicus reported by Lyapunova et al. (1990).
Eolagurus luteus (Eversmann, 1840) . Bull. Soc. Nat. Moscow , p. 25 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kazakhstan , NW of Aral Sea . DISTRIBUTION: Formerly Kazakhstan region, but now extinct (see Corbet, 1978c , and reference therein); Nxingiang ( Ma et al., 1987 ), and W Mongolia . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Corbet (1978c) and Gromov and Polyakov (1977) . Cranial and dental morphology described by Hinton (1926) in context of surveying interrelationships among arvicoline genera.
Eothenomys chinensis (Thomas, 1891) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 8:117 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , W Sichuan , Kiatingfu . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Sichuan and Yunnan between 2000-4000 m ( Corbet, 1978c ). SYNONYMS: tarquinus, wardi . COMMENTS: The type-species of Anteliomys (see Hinton, 1926).
Eolagurus przewalskii (Büchner, 1889) . Wiss. Res. Przewalski Cent .-Asien, Reisen, Zool., I:(Säugeth.), p. 127 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Qinghai (Tsinghai), Tsaidam region, shore of Iche-zaidemin Nor . DISTRIBUTION: From S Xinjiang and N Xizang in W China , east through Quinghai and N Gansu to S Mongolia and Nei Mongol; limits unknown. COMMENTS: This very distinctive species was incorrectly united with E. luteus by Corbet (1978c) but treated as separate by Allen (1940), Corbet and Hill (1991) , and Gromov and Polyakov (1977) .
Eolagurus Argyropulo, 1946 . Vestn. Akad. Nauk Kazakh. SSR, 7-8:44 . TYPE SPECIES: Georychus luteus Eversmann, 1840 . COMMENTS: Corbet (1978c) viewed this taxon as part of Lagurus , but subsequent authorities have considered the two separate genera ( Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Pavlinov and Rossolimo, 1987 ; Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) clarified the taxonomic decisions behind origin of the generic name, and pointed out that Corbet's (1978c) statement that it was meant as a subgenus for luteus may be the first validation of Eolagurus . A member of the tribe Lagurini (see account of Lagurus ).
Eothenomys Miller, 1896 . N. Am. Fauna, 12:45 . TYPE SPECIES: Arvicola melanogaster Milne-Edwards, 1871 . SYNONYMS: Anteliomys , Aschizomys , Caryomys . COMMENTS: Revised by Corbet (1978c) , who also included Phaulomys (a genus we separate from Eothenomys ) and Aschizomys (which we include in Alticola ). Eothenomys is closely related to Hyperacrius , Alticola , and Clethrionomys , all of which are usually placed in the Clethrionomyini ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Koenigswald, 1980 ).
Eothenomys shanseius (Thomas, 1908) . Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1908:643 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Shanxi (Shansi), Chao Cheng Shan (= Mt. Nanyan Shan), 8000 ft ; 37°54'N , lll°30'E (as restricted by Kaneko, 1992:93) . DISTRIBUTION: Shanxi and Hebei provinces, China (see Kaneko, 1992). SYNONYMS: jeholicus. COMMENTS: Regarded by Allen (1940), Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , Gromov and Polyakov (1977) , and Hinton (1926) as a member of Evotomys or Clethrionomys rufocanus , but Corbet (1978c) and Kaneko (1992) reassociated the species with Eothenomys .
Eothenomys inez (Thomas, 1908) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1908(63):45 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Shanxi (Shansi), mtns 12 mi NW Kolanchow, 7000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, China . SYNONYMS: nux . COMMENTS: Following Hinton (1926), inez was synonymized with Clethrionomys rufocanus ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ), but its status as a distinct species of Eothenomys is well documented (Allen, 1940; Corbet, 1978c ; Kaneko, 1992).
Eothenomys melanogaster (Milne-Edwards, 1871) . Nouv. Arch. Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris, Bull., 7:93 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , W Sichuan , Moupin . DISTRIBUTION: W and S China , north to S Gansu and Ningxia , south to N Thailand and N Burma ; also on Taiwan . SYNONYMS: aurora , bonzo , cachinus , colurnus, confinii, eleusis , fidelis , kanoi , libonotus, miletus , mucronatus . COMMENTS: Allen (1940) treated miletus and eleusis as distinct species, and Corbet (1978c) acknowledged that more than one species may be represented in what he identified as E. melanogaster . After checking large museum series, we share this reservation and only provisionally ally these synonyms with melanogaster pending a systematic revision of the group. Conventional karyotype of Taiwan populations reported by Harada et al. (1991) .
Eothenomys eva (Thomas, 1911) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1911 (90):4 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Gansu ( Kansu ), SE of Tauchow, 10,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: China , mtns of S Gansu and adjoining regions of Shaanxi , Sichuan , and Hubei (Allen, 1940; Corbet, 1978c ; Kaneko, 1992). SYNONYMS: alcinous , aquilus . COMMENTS: Listed as a member of Evotomys or Clethrionomys by Hinton (1926), Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , and Gromov and Polyakov (1977) , but correctly described and revised as a distinct species of Eothenomys by Allen (1940), Corbet (1978c) , and Kaneko (1992).
Eothenomys proditor Hinton, 1923 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 11:152 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Yunnan , Likiang Range ( 27°30'N ), 13,000 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the mtns of Yunnan and Sichuan , China (Allen, 1940; Corbet, 1978c ). COMMENTS: Treated as a species of Eothenomys by Hinton (1926), but placed in Anteliomys by Gromov and Polyakov (1977) .
Eothenomys olitor (Thomas, 1911) . Abstr. Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1911 (100):50 . TYPE LOCALITY: China , Yunnan , Chaotungfu, 6700 ft . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from Yunnan between 6000-7000 ft (see Allen, 1940). COMMENTS: Hinton (1926) recognized this species as a member of Eothenomys , but Gromov and Polyakov (1977) placed it in Anteliomys .
Eothenomys regulus (Thomas, 1907) . Proc. Zool. Soc. London, 1906:863 [1907]. TYPE LOCALITY: Korea , Mingyong, HO mi SE Seoul . DISTRIBUTION: Korea . COMMENTS: Usually included in Clethrionomys rufocanus (Allen, 1940; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ) but treated as a separate species by Corbet (1978c) . In a careful morphological study of C. rufocanus and E. regulus from the former USSR, NE China , and Korea , Kaneko (1990) discovered E. regulus to be a Korean endemic and suggested (p. 129) "that the true geographical demarcation line between the two species lies on the western and southern boundary of the Kaima Plateau, North Korea ."
Dinaromys bogdanovi (Martino, 1922) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:413 . TYPE LOCALITY: Yugoslavia , Rijeka Prov., Montenegro , Cetinje . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from mountains of Yugoslavia (see map in Petrov and Todorovic, 1982 ); limits unresolved. SYNONYMS: coeruleus, grebenscikovi , korabensis, longipedis, marakovici , preniensis, trebevicensis. COMMENTS: The extant species is most closely related to two Pleistocene species: D. dalmatinus , recorded from N Italy , Yugoslavia , and S Greece (see Petrov and Todorovic, 1982 ); and D. topachevskii from Uzbekistan (see Nesin and Skorik, 1989 ). Zoogeographic aspects of D. bogdanovi were discussed by Petrov (1979) and chromosomal data by Zima and Krâl (1984a) .
Dicrostonyx vinogradovi Ognev, 1948 . [ Mammals of the U.S. S.R. and adjacent countries], 6:509 . TYPE LOCALITY: SE Siberia, Wrangel Island (Os. Vrangelya), off coast of Anadyr region . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. COMMENTS: Included in D. torquatus by Corbet (1978c) , but chromosomal data, morphological traits, and breeding results indicate vinogradovi is a separate species ( Chernyavskii and Kozlovskii, 1980 ).
Dicrostonyx unalascensis Merriam, 1900 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:25 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Alaska , Umnak Island . DISTRIBUTION: Umnak and Unalaska islands of Aleutian Archipelago, Alaska , USA . SYNONYMS: stevensoni . COMMENTS: Only species of Dicrostonyx to lack molt to white winter pelage and acquistion of snow claws (see Rausch and Rausch, 1972 ).
Dicrostonyx torquatus (Pallas, 1778) . Nova Spec. Quad. Glir. Ord., p. 206 . TYPE LOCALITY: Siberia, mouth of River Ob . DISTRIBUTION: Palearctic tundra from White Sea, W Russia , to Chukotski Peninsula, NE Siberia, and Kamchatka ; including Novaya Zemlya and New Siberian islands, Arctic Ocean (see Corbet, 1978c ). SYNONYMS: chionopaes , lenae , lenensis , pallida , ungulatus . COMMENTS: Chromosomal traits of populations from the Polar Urals (D. t. torquatus ), the Laptev Sea coast and Rautan Island off the coast of the Chukotka Peninsula (D. f. chionopaes ) are similar, and progeny of crosses between these two subspecies are fertile (Gileva, 1980). Unusual sex-chromosome constitution and other chromosomal information were summarized by Gileva et al. (1980) , Gileva (1983), and Zima and Krâl (1984a) . Once believed to encompass most or all New World populations (e.g., Rausch, 1953 , 19636) but their level of relationship to D. torquatus proper is now unclear (see remarks under genus).
Dicrostonyx rubricatus (Richardson, 1889) . Zool. Capt. Beechey's Voy., p. 7 . TYPE LOCALITY: USA , Alaska , Bering Strait . DISTRIBUTION: N Alaska , USA . SYNONYMS: alascensis .
Dicrostonyx richardsoni Merriam, 1900 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:26 . TYPE LOCALITY: Canada , Manitoba , Fort Churchill . DISTRIBUTION: W coast of Hudson Bay west to vicinity of Great Slave Lake, District of MacKenzie, Canada ; extent of westward distribution unknown.
Dinaromys Kretzoi, 1955 . Acta Geol. Acad. Sci. Hung., 3:347 -353. TYPE SPECIES: Microtus (Chionomys) marakovici Bolkay, 1924 (= Microtus bogdanovi Martino, 1922 ). COMMENTS: Often referenced as Dolomys until Corbet (1978c) explained the correct usage of Dinaromys for bogdanovi . The genus has been allocated to the Ondatrini (see Corbet, 1978c ) or Clethrionomyini ( Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ), but Kretzoi's (1969) referral to the Pliomyini perhaps reflects a stronger hypothesis of its phylogenetic affinities (also see Zagorodnyuk, 1990 ). Based on molar enamel microstructure, Koenigswald (1980) discovered no close affinity with any living arvicoline and suggested a relationship with an extinct species of Propliomys , a late Pliocene genus also placed in Pliomyini by Kretzoi (1969) .
Ellobius alaicus Vorontsov et al., 1969 . In Vorontsov (ed.), [The Mammals: Evolution, karyology, taxonomy, fauna], Novosibirsk , p. 127 . TYPE LOCALITY: Kirghizia , Alai Valley, between Sary-Tashem and Bardabo, 3300 m . DISTRIBUTION: Recorded only from the Alai Mtns, S Kirghizia . COMMENTS: Subgenus Ellobius . Included, with question, in E. talpinus by Corbet (1978c) . Chromosomal data and breeding results reveal that alaicus does not belong in E. talpinus and is reproductively isolated from E. tancrei , with which it is parapatric ( Corbet, 1984 ; Lyapunova et al., 1990, and references therein). Closely related to E. tancrei and provisionally placed in that species by Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) .
Ellobius lutescens Thomas, 1897 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 20:308 . TYPE LOCALITY: Turkey , Kurdistan, Van . DISTRIBUTION: From S Caucasus Mtns south through E Turkey and NW Iran . COMMENTS: Subgenus Afganomys . Treated by Corbet (1978c) as a synonym of E. fuscocapillus but now shown to be a distinct species ( Corbet, 1984 ; Vorontsov et al., 1980 , and references therein), as earlier listed by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) . This is a species with a low diploid number (17) and an unusual mode of sex determination, which has been the subject of the many reports reviewed by Zima and Krâl (1984a) , as well as current inquiry ( Vogel et al., 1988 , and references therein).
Ellobius fuscocapillus Blyth, 1843 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 11:887 . TYPE LOCALITY: Pakistan , Baluchistan Region , Quetta Div., Quetta . DISTRIBUTION: E Iran , Afghanistan , W Pakistan , and S Turkmenistan in the Kopet Dag Mtns. SYNONYMS: farsistani , intermedius . COMMENTS: Subgenus Afganomys . Chromosomal data presented by Vorontsov et al. (1980) and Lyapunova et al. (1980) in context of assessing specific differences within the genus and variation in sex chromosomes. Morphology described in detail by Hinton (1926), in context of surveying interrelationships among arvicoline genera.
Ellobius Fischer, 1814 . Zoognosia, 3:72 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus talpinus Pallas, 1770 . SYNONYMS: Afganomys , Afghanomys , Chthonergus , Lemmomys , Myospalax (of Blyth, 1846, not Laxmann, 1769, or Hermann, 1783 ). COMMENTS: Gromov and Polyakov (1977) excluded Ellobius from arvicolines, and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) viewed the Ellobiini as Cricetidae incertae sedis, questioning whether it belonged in Arvicolinae or Cricetinae . Most workers, however, have recognized Ellobius , albeit highly specialized and unusual, as the only extant member of the tribe Ellobiini of Arvicolinae ( Corbet, 1978c ; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Kretzoi, 1969 ; Topachevskii and Rekovets, 1982 ). Topachevskii and Rekovets (1982) interpreted relationships and morhological trends in diversification within the genus from the late Pliocene to Recent. The present range of Ellobius is only part of a wider distribution that once embraced Israel and North Africa in the middle to late Pleistocene (Jaeger, 1988). Ultrastructure, meiotic behavior, and evolution of sex chromosomes in the genus are discussed by Kolomiets et al. (1991) . Two subgenera are recognized, Ellobius and Afganomys ; Zagorodnyuk (1990) listed the latter as a genus.

Dicrostonyx Gloger, 1841 . Gemein Hand.- Hilfsbuch. Nat., 1:97 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus hudsonius Pallas, 1778 . SYNONYMS: Borioikon , Cuniculus , Misothermus , Tylonyx. COMMENTS: At first Dicrostonyx was grouped with other lemmings following Miller's (1896) classic Lemmi-Microti division (e.g., Ellerman, 1941 ; Hinton, 1926; Ognev, 19636; Simpson, 1945 ). An impressive variety of data, however, requires its tribal separation (Dicrostonychini) from the true lemmings ( Lemmini ) and suggests that the origin of Dicrostonyx dates to the earliest radiation of arvicolines ( Carleton, 1981 ; Chaline and Graf, 1988 ; Gromov and Polyakov, 1977 ; Hinton, 1926; Hooper and Hart, 1962 ; Kretzoi, 1969 ; Modi, 1987 ). The simple viewpoint of a single circumpolar species, D. torquatus, as advanced by Ognev (1963b) and Rausch (1953 , 19636), has been unsettled by karyotypic reports of the past two decades ( Chernyavskii and Kozlovskii, 1980 ; Kröhne, 1982 ; Rausch, 1977 ; Rausch and Rausch, 1972 ). The occurrence of varying lemmings in quite different tundra biotopes (e.g., see Youngman, 1975 ) alone might have questioned the existence of only one species, but the karyological and breeding results of Rausch and Rausch (1972) first drew attention to the possibility of a superspecies complex among North American Dicrostonyx, an interpretation reiterated by Rausch (1977 ; see summary of chromosomal variation in Kröhne, 1982 ). Later authorities either listed the North American karyotypic morphs as species ( Corbet and Hill, 1991 ; Honacki et al., 1982 ; Jones et al., 1986 ) or continued to recognize most as subspecies of D. groenlandicus, together with D. exsul on St. Lawrence Island and D. hudsonius on the Ungava Peninsula ( Hall, 1981 ). After examining museum specimens, we readily appreciate the specific distinctiveness of groenlandicus, hudsonius, richardsoni, and unalascensis. The morphological discrimination of others (kilangmiutak, nelsoni, and rubricatus) is more subtle but may yield to careful description and analysis; we have not seen examples of nunatakensis, an isolated taxon described as a subspecies of torquatus by Youngman (1967) . Unfortunately, the provocative findings of Rausch and others have not been explored and substantiated using other taxonomic information; in this regard, Youngman's (1975) narrative overview of species and racial distributions warrants attention in future efforts. We herein continue to list the species of Dicrostonyx as provisional and stress that their repetition in checklists like this enhances neither our confidence in the number of biological entities nor our understanding of their biogeographic significance.

COMMENTS: Tribe Cynomyini ( Gromov et al., 1965 ) or Marmotini . Revised by Pizzimenti (1975). Clark et al. (1971) published a key to the genus. Includes Cynomys and Leucocrossuromys as subgenera. Relationships of Cynomys to other ground squirrels are unclear. While generally regarded as monophyletic, and a sister-group to North American Spermophilus, recent evidence suggests that Cynomys may be most closely related to subgenus Spermophilus, making genus Spermophilus paraphyletic (Hafner, 1984:17).

Family Sciuridae Hemprich, 1820 . Grundriss Naturgesch., p. 32 . COMMENTS: Ellerman (1940) reviewed the history of sciurid classification. The first modern classification ( Pocock, 1923 ) recognized six subfamilies: Sciurinae , Tamiasciurinae, Funambulinae, Callosciurinae, Xerinae , and Marmotinae. Simpson (1945) recognized the same taxa, but all at the tribal level. Ellerman (1940) avoided formal designation, but recognized seven "sections" in the Sciurus "group, " which often do not conform with the above. Moore (1959) recognized Simpson's six tribes and, in addition, Ratufini and Paraxerini for certain genera that had previously been included in Funambulini . Black (1963) elevated Tamiini to tribal level (previously in Marmotini ). Gromov et al. (1965) elevated the ground squirrels to subfamily rank, Marmotinae, which included the tribes Tamiini Black, Otospermophilini Gromov, Citellini Gromov, Marmotini Simpson (part), and Cynomyini Gromov. He also recognized the subfamilies Xerinae and Sciurinae , but did not treat any other groups. Emry and Thorington (1984) submerged Tamiasciurini in Sciurini and Tamiini in Marmotini . They also (1982) described the oldest known sciurid, Protosciurus , which they interpreted as an arboreal form similar to Sciurus from which both flying squirrels and ground squirrels have been derived. These authors treated flying squirrels as a monophyletic sister group to other squirrels, either as a family ( Pocock, 1923 ) or subfamily (other authors). The monophyly of flying squirrels has been both supported ( Thorington, 1984 ) and challenged ( Hight et al., 1974 ). Heaney (1985) recommended that the subtribe Hyosciurina of Moore (1959) be discarded because it lacks defining characters, and that the component genera ( Hyosciurus , Prosciurillus , Rubisciurus, and Exilisciurus ) be retained in tribe Callosciurini Simpson, 1945 . A catolog of Indian sciurids was presented by Agrawal and Chakraborty (1979) .

COMMENTS: Placed in Euxerus which is considered a subgenus of Xerus by Ellerman (1940) , Moore (1959) , and Amtmann (1975) . The name erythopus or erythropus is commonly attributed to E. Geoffroy, 1803 . Cat. Mamm. Mus . Hist. Nat., Paris, p. 178, who gave the name as erythopus; however, this work was never published and is therefore unavailable (see Appendix I). The next available use of the name erythopus was by Desmarest, 1817. Shinz, 1845, used the spelling erythropus . Opinion 945 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (1971) ruled that erythopus Geoffroy, 1803 be changed to erythropus as an incorrect original spelling. The proper latin root is "erythro". In the last 100 years nearly all authors have used the spelling erythropus . In the interest of orthographic stability we advocate that the specific name be spelled erythropus . It is not desirable to perpetuate the lapsus in spelling by early workers.

Subfamily Melinae Bonaparte, 1838 . Nuovi Ann Sci. Nat., 2:111 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Long (1978) and Long and Killingley (1983) . Revised by Pocock (1921 b , d, 1941a), Petter (1971), and Wozencraft (1989a) , who suggested that this may not be a monophyletic group. Pocock recognized as subfamilies, and Petter as tribes, four groups: (1) Meles , Arctonyx ; (2) Melogale ; (3) Mydaus ; and (4) Taxidea . Pocock (1920b) , Long (1981) , and Wozencraft (1989b) argued for the separation of Taxidea into a monotypic subfamily, Taxidiinae , which would be consistent with the phylogenetic hypotheses refered to above and which will be followed here. Petter (1971), Radinsky (1973) , and Schmidt-Kittler (1981) suggested that Mydaus may be the sister group to Mephitinae . Its placement in this subfamily is provisional.

Cuvier, 1821 (= Mephitis javanensis Desmarest, 1820 ). SYNONYMS: Suillotaxus Lawrence, 1939 . COMMENTS: Lawrence (1939) believed that differences in dentition and pelage warranted separation of these taxa into separate, monotypic genera (i.e., Suillotaxus marchei , Mydaus javanensis ). These differences parallel those found within the genus Melogale ( Long and Killingley, 1983 ). This genus is provisionally placed in Melinae (see comments therein), its position may be better considered as incertae sedis.

COMMENTS: There is considerable controversy over the correct name for this genus (Herschkovitz, 1955b; Van Gelder, 1966 ). Zorilla Oken, 1816, is invalid ( International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1956b ). Zorilla Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1826 , was suppressed under the plenary powers for the purposes of the Principle of Priority ( International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1967 ). Rosevear (1974) strongly suggested, and Dekeyser (1955) and Niethammer (1987a) argued that Poecilictis Thomas and Hinton, 1920 , and Ictonyx are congeneric. The principal skull features used to erect the new genus by Thomas and Hinton (1920) could not be supported when a more extensive series of specimens was measured ( Rosevear, 1974 ).

Family Ursidae Fischer, 1817 . Mém. Soc. Imp. Nat. Moscow , 5:372 . COMMENTS: Ailurus and Ailuropoda have been placed in a separate family by some; however, morphological and molecular evidence strongly supports the placement of Ailuropoda in this family ( Chorn and Hoffmann, 1978 ; Davis, 1964; Goldman et al., 1989 ; Hendy, 1980«; O'Brien et al., 1985 ; Wozencraft, 1989«). Thenius (1979) placed Ailuropoda in the monotypic family Ailuropodidae, and Ailurus in the Procyonidae. The placement of Ailurus is certainly more controversial, with most phenetic studies placing it in the procyonids and most phylogenetic studies placing it near or in the ursids. See comments under Ailurus concerning its placement here. Morphological studies have supported the monophyly of three subfamilies (Hendy, 1980«; Kurtén, 1966 ; Thenius, 1979 ), although this has not been collaborated by a recent molecular approach ( Goldman et al., 1989 ).

Ailurus F. G. Cuvier, 1825 . In E. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and F. G. Cuvier, Hist. Nat. Mammifèeres, pt. 3, 5(50), "Panda" 3 pp. TYPE SPECIES: Ailurus fulgens F. G. Cuvier, 1825 , by monotypy ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). COMMENTS: Biochemical and molecular evidence has suggested that the enigmatic Ailurus is intermediate between the procyonids and the ursids ( O'Brien et al., 1985 ; Sarich, 1973 ; Tagle et al., 1986 ; Wayne et al., 1989 ; Wurster and Benirschke, 1968 ); more closely related to ursids than to procyonids (Todd and Pressmann, 1968; Zhang and Shi, 1991); or more closely related to the procyonids than to ursids ( Goldman et al., 1989 ). Morphological studies have pointed out the lack of any shared derived features with the procyonids ( Bugge, 1978 ; Decker and Wozencraft, 1991 ; Ginsburg, 1982 ; Hunt, 1974 ; Mayr, 1986 ; Schmidt-Kittler, 1981 ; Wozencraft, 1989«, b). Flynn et al. (1988) could not find any unambiguous features to place Ailurus with the procyonids, and only two characters to unite Ailurus with some procyonids, the loss of M/ 3 (shared also with mustelids) and the presence of a cusp on P4 on some, but not all procyonids. Wozencraft (1989«) found 9 shared derived features with the Ursidae , and Decker and Wozencraft (1991) identified 6 unambiguous shared derived features of the procyonids, all of which are lacking in Ailurus . Only phenetic studies have indicated any kind of relationship to the procyonids ( Gregory, 1936 ; Thenius, 1979 ) and only when compared to Procyon , a derived procyonid ( Baskin, 1982 , 1989 ; Decker and Wozencraft, 1991 ).

COMMENTS: Reviewed by Couturier (1954) , Rausch (1963a) , Kurtén (1973) , and Hall (1984) . Ognev (1931) and Allen (1938) recognized If. pruinosus as distinct; not followed by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , Gao (1987) , and Strognov (1962). Lönnberg (1923b) believed that differences between pruinosus and arctos warranted subgeneric distinction as (Mylarctos) pruinosus ; however, this was not supported by Pocock's (1932a) thorough revision.
Ursus Linnaeus, 1758 . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:47 . TYPE SPECIES: Ursus arctos Linnaeus, 1758 , by tautonymy ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). SYNONYMS: Thalarctos . COMMENTS: The close relationship of these four species has been generally recognized by morphological and molecular studies ( Goldman et al., 1989 ; Hendey, 1980a ; Kurtén and Anderson, 1980 ; Shields and Kocher, 1990). Allen (1938) proposed a close relationship between thibetanus and americanus . Thenius (1953) , Goldman et al. (1989) , and Shields and Kocher (1991) gave support to the monophyly of arctos with maritimus .
Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780 . Spicil. Zool., 14:5 . TYPE LOCALITY: Not given. In Pallas' (1780) description, he refered to Brickell (1737) who implied North Carolina ( USA ) by stating they "are very common in this province." Palmer (1904) listed the locality as "eastern North America" .

Subfamily Ursinae Fischer, 1817 . Mém. Soc. Imp. Nat. Moscow , 5:372 . COMMENTS: Revised by Erdbrink (1953) . Although there is general agreement as to the monophyletic origin of this subfamily, there is considerable disagreement as to the relationships within ( Goldman et al., 1989 ; Hendy, 1980a; Thenius, 1979 ). Erdbrink (1953) collapsed all taxa into a broadly encompassing " Ursus "; also suggested by the hybridization criteria of Van Gelder (1977b) . A consensus tree, not shown, but derived from hypotheses presented in Goldman et al. (1989) would not elucidate relationships below this level. Simpson (1945) followed Pocock (1941a) and recognized these taxa as monotypic genera.
Melursus ursinus (Shaw, 1791) . Nat. Mise., 2 (unpaged) pl. 58 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Abinteriore Bengala"; restricted by Pocock (1941a) as "Patna, north of the Ganges, Bengal" [ India ] .

SYNONYMS: ochraceus Hodgson, 1847 ; refulgens Milne-Edwards, 1868 ; styani Thomas, 1902. COMMENTS: Although this species is sometimes included in the Procyonidae because of its ringed tail, and superficial resemblance of teeth and rounded skull to Procyon , this species does not have the shared derived morphological characters that would place it there ( Decker and Wozencraft, 1991 ). See comments under the genus. Nearly all of the derived features that it shares with Ailuropoda (and not with other bears) relate directly to feeding on bamboo (Davis, 1964; Gregory, 1936 ).

COMMENTS: Revised by Pocock (1932b) . Van Gelder (1977) placed Helarctos in Melursus . Pocock (1941a) first suggested the close relationship between M. ursinus and H. malayanus ; however, this was not well supported by Goldman et al. (1989) .
Tremarctos Gervais, 1855 . Hist. Nat. Mammifères, 2:20 . TYPE SPECIES: Ursus ornatus F. G. Cuvier, 1825 . COMMENTS: Thenius (1976) argued that differences between Tremarctos and other bears warranted separation at the subfamily level, however, Kurtén (1966) and Hendey (1980a) supported its inclusion here.

Eupleres Doyère, 1835 . Bull. Soc. Sci. Nat., 3:45 . TYPE SPECIES: Eupleres goudotii Doyère, 1835 , by monotypy ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). COMMENTS: Gregory and Hellman (1939) followed Chenu (1852), and suggested placing Eupleres in a separate family; however, Albignac (1973 , 1974 ), Petter (1974) , Coetzee (1977b) , and Wozencraft (1989a) included it in Viverridae .
Subfamily Cryptoproctinae Gray, 1865 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1864:508 [1865]. COMMENTS: Type genus: Cryptoprocta Bennett, 1833 , by monotypy ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). Considered a subfamily of felids by Gregory and Hellman (1939) and Beaumont (1964) . There is disagreement as to the proper subfamilies for the Malagasy viverrids; see Pocock (1915a) , Petter (1974) , and Wozencraft (1989a , b).
Cryptoprocta Bennett, 1833 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1833:46 . TYPE SPECIES: Cryptoprocta ferox Bennett, 1833 , by original designation ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). COMMENTS: Beaumont (1964) placed Cryptoprocta with the Felidae because of similarities in dental characters. Albignac (1970) , Thenius (1972) , Radinsky (1975) , Coetzee (1977b) , Flynn et al. (1988) , and Wozencraft (1989a , b) placed it in the Viverridae ; Hemmer (1978) suggested an intermediate position.
Subfamily Euplerinae Chenu, 1852 . Ency. Hist. Nat., 21:165 . COMMENTS: Type genus: Eupleres Doyère, 1835 , by monotypy ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ) for those who consider Eupleres and Hemigalus in different family groups. There is disagreement as to the subfamilies for Malagasy viverrids; Pocock (1915a) placed Fossa in the SE Asian Hemigalinae . The evidence for this is weak ( Albignac, 1973 ; Wozencraft, 1989a ). Gregory and Hellman (1939) , Albignac (1974) , and Petter (1974) , placed it in Fossinae; however, Eupleridae Chenu, 1852 , is the senior synonym.

COMMENTS: Placed in subgenus Selenarctos by Gromov and Baranova (1981) ; and in subgenus Euarctos by Thenius (1979) . Allen (1938) suggested a close relationship to U. americanus ; Pocock (1932&) retained in a separate genus, there is molecular support for both positions ( Goldman et al., 1989 ).

SYNONYMS: Arctogale Gray, 1865 . COMMENTS: Gray's (1864 [1865]) generic name stood until Merriam (1897) pointed out that the name Arctogale was preoccupied (= Arctogale erminea Kaup, 1829 ). First placed in the Paradoxurinae by Gray (1869) ; later separated into the monotypic Arctogalidinae by Pocock (1933d) , and followed by Gregory and Hellman (1939) ; however, Simpson (1945) , and Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) retained it in Paradoxurinae .

COMMENTS: Gervais (1841) was the first to place in Hemigalus . Gray (1849) later considered Paradoxurus derbyanus a junior synonym of Viverra hardwicki Gray, 1830 , and placed it also in the genus Hemigalea after Jourdan (1837) . However, V. hardwicki is a junior synonym of Prionodon linsang Raffles, 1821 .

Listed in Nandiniinae by Gregory and Hellman (1939) , and Coetzee (1977b) ; separated at the family level by Pocock (1929) , and Hunt (1987) . Although Nandinia shares many derived features of the scent gland and external morphology with the viverrids (especially the Paradoxurinae ), Hunt (1987) felt that the retention of the primitive features of the auditory bullae were sufficient to warrant separation at the family level.

DISTRIBUTION: Malaysia ( Sabah , Sarawak ). COMMENTS: Thomas published two accounts of the type description in 1892, one printed in August ( Thomas, 1892a ), and another printed in October ( Thomas, 1892b ). Although Pocock (1933d) supported Thomas (1912) in separating this species into Diplogale ; Chasen (1940) , Medway (1977) , and Payne et al. (1985) did not. Similiar differences in pelage and dentition have been used elsewhere (e.g., Osbornictis vs. Genetta ) at the generic level.

His description, as stated, does not fit any know otariid from this region ( Allen, 1880 , 1905 ). Cabrera (1940) believed that the description was sufficient to distinguish it from Arctocephalus , the only other possibility; based on the molting of young pups. King (1978) who reviewed the controversy, pointed out that at molting stage, the size of the pup would exclude it from Shaw's (1800) description.

Muizon (1982«), and Wyss's (1988) phylogenetic analyses agreed on three areas: 1) The monophyletic nature of two groups they refer to as the Lobodontini ( Hydrurga , Leptonychotes , Lobodon , and Ommatophoca ), and the Phocinae (Erignathus, Cystophora, Halichoerus, and Phoca), 2) The lobodonts, along with Monachus and Mirounga have been traditionally refered to as the Monachinae (kept by Muizon), however, they both suggested that this group may be paraphyletic, 3) Because of the "unsettled" nature of these taxa, no subfamilies are recognized at this time.

Some ( Honacki et al., 1982 ; Van Gelder, 1977b) have followed Simpson (1945) and placed the majority of taxa in Felis , except for the large cats ( Panthera and Acinonyx ); however, this is not well supported by primary systematic studies and only poorly represents relationships below the family level. Although taxonomic disagreements appear at first to be considerable, most revolve around the recognition of categories at the generic versus the subgeneric level and interpretations of degrees of similarity.

ORDER CARNIVORA COMMENTS: Recent studies on family level relationships have agreed in several key areas, among which are: (1) The sister group to the Carnivora is the +Creodonta. (2) The Recent Carnivora are organized into two monophyletic groups; Suborder Feliformia : felids, herpestids, hyaenids and viverrids; and Suborder Caniformia : canids, ursids, mustelids, odobenids, otariids, phocids, and procyonids. (3) The pinnipeds (otariids, odobenids, and phocids) are included within the suborder Caniformia ; placing them in a separate Order would make the Carnivora paraphyletic ( Flynn et al., 1988 ; Tedford, 1976 ; Wozencraft, 1989a ; Berta, 1991 ).

The widely used name C. niger is invalid (International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1957«). The validity of rufus as a full species was questioned by Clutton-Brock et al. (1976) , due to the existence of natural hybrids with lupus and latrans . Natural hybridization may be a consequence of habitat disruption by man ( Paradiso and Nowak, 1971 ). Nowak (1979) provided evidence for specific distinctness. All specimens examined by Wayne and Jenks (1991) had either a lupus or latrans mtDNA genotype.

COMMENTS: See comments under Dusicyon . Although combining taxa included here with Dusicyon would not be in conflict with Berta (1987 , 1988 ), her analyses suggested that other genera, now extinct, are more closely related to Dusicyon . Berta (1987 , 1988 ) presented derived features that would support a single origin for those taxa recognized here in Pseudalopex (which would also agree with Cabrera, 1958 and Stains, 1975 ). A detailed comparative morphological study by Langguth (1969) caused him to conclude (1975:193) that Pseudalopex merited generic rank.

COMMENTS: There has been general disagreement as to generic classification of the South American canids, with most of the disagreement centered on the species australis , culpaeus , griseus , gymnocercus , microtis , sechurae , thous , and vetulus . Van Gelder (1978) proposed placing these taxa into Canis and giving only subgeneric recognition. The other extreme is best represented by Cabrera (1931) who recognized 5 genera for this group. Langguth (1969) first followed Cabrera's classification, but later (1975) decided to group most taxa into Canis , because he felt differences were not sufficient to warrant generic distinctions. The phenetic approaches of Clutton-Brock et al. (1976) and Wayne and O'Brien (1987) confirmed the close similarities of these taxa. Berta's (1987 , 1988 ) phylogenetic hypothesis is followed here.

Herpestes Illiger, 1811 . Prodr. Syst. Mamm. Avium., p. 135 . TYPE SPECIES: Viverra ichneumon Linnaeus, 1758 , by absolute tautonomy, through the replaced name Ichneumon Lacépède, 1799 ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). COMMENTS: Revised by Pocock (1919 , 1937 , 1941a ) and Bechthold (1939) . Coetzee (1977b), and Hayman (in Sanderson, 1940 ) included Xenogale (see discussion under naso ). Allen (1924) , considered only ichneumon in this genus and separated sanguineus and pulverulentus into Galerella ; for support, he contrasted the large ichneumon with the smaller sanguineus-pulverulentus complex and reported proportional differences in measurements of skeleton and skull. His rationale has been repeated, in some cases verbatum, by Rosevear (1974) , Ansell (1978) , Smithers (1983) , Meester et al. (1986) , and Watson and Dippenaar (1987) . Taylor et al. (1991) presented an allozyme analysis and argued for generic recognition, however, they did not include Asiatic Herpestes , and their consensus tree made the placement of the sanguineus / pulverulentus clade equivocal. Fredga's (1972) comparative chromosome analysis looked at variation including Asiatic and African Herpestes, and based on this, recognition of Galerella would make Herpestes paraphyletic. Comparison of measurements from Allen (1924) , Rosevear (1974) , and Smithers (1983) for African forms, and Bechthold (1939) and Pocock (1941a) for Asiatic forms reveals that the large morphological gaps originally identified by Allen (1924) , dissolve when Asiatic species are included. Ellerman et al. (1953) and Wozencraft (1989b) suggested that differences between these taxa and other Herpestes are less than those found within Herpestes . Morphological criteria similar to that used by Allen (1924) have mostly been used at the specific level in other carnivores. Although the case is not strong, many recent authors have recognized Galerella and this is provisionally followed here (see comments under Galerella).

COMMENTS: Bechthold (1939) , followed here, included hosei and fusca , and listed characteristics suggesting that in some respects, semitorquatus was intermediate between brachyurus and urva ; this was followed by Medway (1977) . Bechthold (1939) believed that /usc« (sensu stricto) is most closely related to far-eastern brachyurus forms and considered them conspecific (both forms are short tailed mongooses); however, he gave features of the skull and pelage (used elsewhere at the specific level, i.e., edwardsii vs. javanicus ) that distinguished the S India /Sri Lankan populations from those of SE Asia. Here they are provisionally treated as allopatric subspecies. Schwarz (1947) believed semitorcjuatus to be a red color morph of the dark brachyurus , although he did not address the most distinguishing feature of the collared mongoose - the collar - present in semitorquatus and absent in brachyurus . Medway (1977) , followed by Payne et al. (1985) , recognized hosei based on differences in the shape of the coronoid process of the mandible.

COMMENTS: This engimatic group, reviewed by Taylor (1975) , is represented by several allopatric populations (A situation similar to the Genetta genetta complex where they are recognized as conspecific). Watson and Dippenaar (1987) , in their revision, argued for the separation of nigratus Thomas, 1928 (= flavescens ), and swalius Thomas, 1926 , and considered swinnyi Roberts, 1913 , as incertae sedis (included here), although their study did not include representative samples from NE and W Africa. It is believed that swinnyi has been extirpated from the type locality (Watson, in litt.). Taylor (1989) suggested that the allopatric ochraceus from Somalia warrants full specific status. Certainly, these studies suggests that a thorough revision, inclusive of all of the African forms of sanguinea is badly needed.

Hayman (in Sanderson, 1940 ), Wenzel and Haltenorth (1972) , and Coetzee (1977b) did not feel these differences were sufficient to warrant generic distinction, as did Allen (1919b) , and Rosevear (1974) . Recognition of Xenogale would make Herpestes paraphyletic.

COMMENTS: Van Zyll de Jong (1972 , 1987 , 1991a ) argued that the New World otters represent a single radiation and questioned whether Lutra (sensu stricto) or Aonyx was the closest sister group. There has been no published work to refute his hypothesis, although it has not received general acceptance. Hall (1981) chose not to question the monophyletic nature of the group, but to lower it to the subgeneric rank, feeling that the characters where not sufficient enough to warrant generic distinction. Regardless of the "morphological gap" between the monophyletic New World otters and the Old World otters, if Lutra (sensu stricto) is the closest sister group, then inclusion within Lutra could be maintained. However, if, as van Zyll de Jong (1987) suggested, Aonyx is the closest outgroup, then recognition at the generic level is necessary.

COMMENTS: Placed in Prionailurus by Pocock (1917), Weigel (1961) , Hemmer (1978) , Groves (1982a) , and Kratochvfl (1982c). Includes euptilura following Allen (1939) and Gao (in Gao, 1987 ). Heptner (1971) and Gromov and Baranova (1981) , considered euptilura a distinct species; however, Gao (in Gao, 1987 ) pointed out that Heptner compared Russian specimens with those from Southeast Asia, whereas when intervening Chinese populations are included, his distinctions do not hold. Includes minuta following Chasen (1940) . Imaizumi (1967) described Mayailurus iriomotensis , but his key characters are polymorphic in bengalensis ( Glass and Todd, 1977 ; Petzsch, 1970 ). Groves (1982a) believed that iriomotensis warranted species level recognition.

Subfamily Herpestinae Bonaparte, 1845 . Cat. Meth. Mamm. Europe, p. 3 . COMMENTS: Type genus: Herpestes liliger, 1811 ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). Thomas (1882) proposed a separate monotypic subfamily (Surcatinae) for Suricata . Wozencraft (1989b) placed Crossarchus , Cynictis , Dologale , Helogale , Liberiictis , Mungos , Paracynictis , and Suricata in the Mungotinae but gave no supporting rationale. Fredga's (1972) analysis of chromosomes would support Wozencraft's Mungotinae (with the inclusion of Bdeogale and Ichneumia). The phylogenetic analysis of allozyme data by Taylor et al. (1991) also supported Cynictis, Suricata, and Helogale as a monophyletic group.
Atilax F. G. Cuvier, 1826 . In E. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and F. G. Cuvier, Hist. Nat. Mammifères, pt. 3, 5(54), "Vansire," 2 pp. TYPE SPECIES: Herpestes paludinosus G. [Baron] Cuvier, 1829, by original designation ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). COMMENTS: Fredga's (1972) comparative chromosome study of mongooses suggested that recognition of Atilax as distinct from Herpestes would make Herpestes paraphyletic. However, allozyme data support Atilax as the first early offshoot of the main herpestine branch ( Taylor et al., 1991 ).

COMMENTS: Revised by Lynch (1981) , Watson and Dippenaar (1987) , Watson (1990) , and Taylor et al. (1991) who considered these taxa a monophyletic group. CrawfordCabral (1989a:2) regarded these taxa as a "superspecies with several allospecies." These taxa are provisionally separated from Herpestes (sensu latu) following these revisions and reviews by Rosevear (1974) , Ansell (1978) , Smithers (1983) , and Meester et al. (1986) (see discussion under Herpestes ).
Bdeogale Peters, 1850 . Spenersche Z., 25 June, 1850 (unpaginated). TYPE SPECIES: Bdeogale crassicauda Peters, 1852 ; by subsequent designation by Thomas (1882) ( Melville and Smith, 1987 ). COMMENTS: Matschie (1895) , Pocock (1916«), Coetzee (19776), Kingdon (1977) , and Meester et al. (1986) included Galeriscus Thomas, 1894 . Rosevear (1974) believed that no one had advanced any "reasoned argument" for combining Galeriscus with Bdeogale , and followed Schouteden (1945) and Hill and Carter (1941) who considered them distinct; all have agreed that jacksoni and nigripes are sister groups.

COMMENTS: Subgenus Megascapheus . The taxonomic history of this, and related species has been contentious. Hall and Kelson (1959) included bottae within umbrinus but considered baileyi and townsendii as separate species, but Hall (1981) included all four of these taxa within his concept of umbrinus . Anderson (1966 , 1972 ), Hoffmeister (1969 , 1986 ), and Patton and co-workers ( Patton and Dingman, 1968 ; Patton, 1973 ; Patton and Smith, 1981 ) considered bottae (including baileyi) separate from umbrinus . Thaeler (19686), Patton et al. (1984) , Patton and Smith (1989) , and Rogers (1991«, 6) supported the specific separation of townsendii from Hall's (1981) umbrinus . As envisioned here, bottae includes a number of taxa considered by earlier workers to be full species but which are each now relegated to subspecific status or are recognized as synonyms of other subspecies. Revisions of those subspecies occurring in Arizona and California have been presented by Hoffmeister (1986) and Patton and Smith (1990) , respectively. Hoffmeister (1969) , Patton and Dingman (1968) , and Patton (1973) reported on hybridization between bottae and umbrinus in S Arizona ; Thaeler (19686) and Patton et al. (1984) examined hybridization between bottae and townsendii in NE California . For subspecies, see Hall (1981) , as modified for Arizona by Hoffmeister (1986) , and for California by Patton and Smith (1990) .
Thomomys Wied-Neuwied, 1839 . Nova Acta Phys.-Med. Acad. Caes. Leop.-Carol., 19(1):377 . TYPE SPECIES: Thomomys rufescens Wied-Neuwied, 1939 (= T. talpoides rufescens ). SYNONYMS: Megascapheus Elliot, 1903 . COMMENTS: Recent species allocated to two subgenera ( Thaeler, 1980 ): Thomomys , which includes the species talpoides , clusius , idahoensis , mazama , and monticola ; and Megascapheus including bottae, bulbivorus, townsendii, and umbrinus. Phylogenetic relationships among members of the subgenus Megascapheus were presented by Patton and Smith (1981) , based on molecular data. Specific boundaries for some forms are poorly defined, but Patton and Smith (1989) provided an operational definition that can be applied to all pocket gophers.

COMMENTS: Hybridization with bottae reported in Patagonia Mtns of S Arizona by Patton and Dingman (1968) , Patton (1973) , and Hoffmeister (1969) . Considered a species separate from bottae by these authors and by Anderson (1966 , 1972 ). Hall (1981:469) included baileyi, bottae , and townsendii in this species based on a his view of the hybridization data in Hoffmeister (1969) , Patton (1973) , and Thaeler (1968b) ; he reported intergradation between umbrinus and bottae in Nuevo Leon ( Mexico ).

COMMENTS: Formerly included idahoensis and clusius ; see Thaeler (1972) and Thaeler and Hinesley (1979) . Partial revision by Bailey (1915) and Thaeler (1985) . The considerable degree of chromosomal differentiation among geographic representatives of this form ( Thaeler, 1985 ) suggests that more than one biological species is currently included under the name talpoides .

COMMENTS: For subspecies, see Hall (1981:499-500) . Revised by Merriam (1895a) and, in part, by Honeycutt and Schmidly (1979) . The form lutescens was considered as a valid species by Heaney and Timm (1983 a, 1985 ) but as a subspecies by Burns et al. (1985) and Sudman et al. (1987) . Tucker and Schmidly (1981) and Williams and Cameron (1991) considered attwateri distinct from bursarius , as did Bradley et al. (1991) for knoxjonesi, Sulentich et al. (1991) for breviceps , and Block and Zimmerman (1991) for attwateri , breviceps , knoxjonesi , and texensis .
Geomys Rafinesque, 1817 . Am. Mon. Mag., 2(1):45 . TYPE SPECIES: Geomys pinetis Rafinesque, 1817 . SYNONYMS: Ascomys Lichtenstein, Diplostoma Rafinesque, Parageomys Hibbard, Pseudostoma Say, Saccophorus Kuhl. COMMENTS: Revised by Merriam (1895a) . Specific boundaries in this genus are poorly defined. Complex relationships have been described for several definable geographic units based on a variety of contact zone analyses that have employed morphological, karyological, allozyme, and/or mitochondrial and nuclear DNA biochemical analyses. These have indicated varying degrees of hybridization between geographically differentiated forms, and authors vary in their recognition of these entities at the specific or subspecific levels. While the rather traditional species ( arenarius , bursarius , personatus , pinetis , and tropicalis ; Hall, 1981 ) are clearly an inadequate representation of specific diversity in the genus (see Block and Zimmerman, 1991 ), this arrangement is followed here due to lack of a thorough geographic analysis throughout the range of the genus and a concensus among workers. Keys to the species of Geomys were published by Baker and Williams (1974) and Hall (1981) .
Family Geomyidae Bonaparte, 1845 . Cat. Meth. Mamm. Europe, p. 5 . COMMENTS: Revised by Russell (1968a) , who placed all Recent genera in one of two tribes in the subfamily Geomyinae : Geomyini ( Geomys , Pappogeomys , Orthogeomys , and Zygogeomys ) and Thomomyini ( Thomomys ); he included Macrogeomys and Heterogeomys as subgenera of Orthogeomys, an action followed by more recent authors ( Hall, 1981 ; Hafner, 1982 , 1991 ), and Cratogeomys as a subgenus of Pappogeomys (see also Russell, 19686). The latter action was accepted by Hall (1981) but not by Jones et al. (1986) , Lee and Baker (1987) , Davidow-Henry et al. (1989) , and Hollander (1990) , who considered Cratogeomys as a separate genus. Platygeomys Merriam was synonymized with Pappogeomys by Hooper (1946) . Phallic morphology has been reviewed by Williams (19826); Hafner (1982) reported on phylogenetic relationships based on biochemical characters; and Wahlert (1985) provided a classification of the superfamily Geomyoidea, including Geomyidae. Russell (1968a) and Hall (1981) provided keys to Recent genera. Specific boundaries within all pocket gopher genera are often difficult to define because of an apparent inability to subdivide the subterranean niche and thus resultant allopatric distribution patterns (see Patton, 1990).

Pappogeomys Merriam, 1895 . N. Am. Fauna, 8:145 . TYPE SPECIES: Geomys bulleri Thomas, 1892 . SYNONYMS: Cratogeomys Merriam, Platygeomys Merriam. COMMENTS: Hooper (1946) included Platygeomys within Pappogeomys . Cratogeomys was recognized by Russell (1968a , b) as a valid subgenus, a position followed by Hall (1981) . Honeycutt and Williams (1982) , based on a phylogenetic analysis of allozyme data, retained alcorni and bulleri in Pappogeomys , but considered Cratogeomys generically distinct, containing the remaining species listed by Russell. Lee and Baker (1987) , Davidow-Henry et al. (1989) , and Hollander (1990) followed Honeycutt and Williams in considering Cratogeomys a distinct genus. Available data ( Russell, 1968a , b; Honeycutt and Williams, 1982 ) support a sister-taxon relationship between Pappogeomys and Cratogeomys, but it remains a matter of personal opinion as to recognition status at the generic or subgeneric levels.

COMMENTS: Subgenus Proeulagus ( Gureev, 1964:198 ) . Formerly included in capensis or europaeus ; see comments therein. Includes tibetanus ; but see also Sokolov and Orlov (1980:85) ; Qui (1989) also provided evidence of differentiation of tibetanus but did not address specific status. Formerly included przewalskii, now assigned to L. oiostolus ; see Cai and Feng (1982) . "The situation in [southern] Iraq [and SW Iran ] deserves a more detailed analysis ( Angermann, 1983:19 ). L. tolai petteri occurs westward to about 55°- 56°E , while L. c. arabicus occurs eastward to SE Iraq . Whether the two forms come into contact is not known, but their ranges may be separated by that of L. europaeus astaricus in SW Iran (and L. e. connorii); see Baloutch (1978) and Angermann (1983) . Angermann (in litt., 1992) considered tolai conspecific with capensis . According to Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951:430) the type locality should be "Adinscholo Mountain, near Tchinden [Chinden = Chindant], on Borsja [Boriya] River, a tributary of the Onon River, Eastern Siberia."

COMMENTS: Placed by Gureev (1964: 144) in Caprolagus (Indolagus) ; he ranked siamensis as a distinct species; but see Lekagul and McNeely (1977:333) and Flux and Angermann (1990) . Petter (1961) suggested that pequensis might be conspecific with nigricollis because of its close resemblance to L. n. ruficaudatus . However, L. n. ruficaudatus appears to be allopatric with respect to pequensis in E India-W Burma . Angermann (in litt., 1992) considered pequensis conspecific with nigricollis .

SYNONYMS: albaniensis Roberts, 1932; aurantii Thomas and Hinton, 1923 ; bechuanae Roberts, 1932; chiversi Roberts, 1929 ; chobiensis Roberts, 1932; damarensis Roberts, 1926; fumigatus Wagner, 1844; gungunyanae Roberts, 1914; khanensis Roberts, 1946 ; longicaudatus Gray, 1837 ; megalotis Thomas and Schwann, 1905 ; ngamiensis Roberts, 1932; nigrescens Roberts, 1932; orangensis Kolbe, 1948; rufinucha A. Smith, 1829; subrufus Roberts, 1913 ; timidus A. Smith, 1826 . COMMENTS: Placed by Gureev (1964:203) in subgenus Proeulagus . Formerly included crawshayi and whytei, see Ansell (1978:67) , Swanepoel et al. (1980:159) , and Robinson and Dippenaar (1983 b, 1987 ); but see also Petter (1961, 1972b). Angermann (1983) considered whytei a distinct species that includes crawshayi ; Flux and Angermann (1990) placed both as subspecies of victoriae . Angermann (in litt., 1992) would restrict saxatilis to the following taxa: albaniensis, aurantii, chiversi, fumigatus, longicaudatus, megalotis, rufinucha, and timidus ; transfering the remainder to victoriae .
Lepus timidus Linnaeus, 1758 . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:57 . TYPE LOCALITY: "in Europa" [ Uppsala , Sweden ] . DISTRIBUTION: Palearctic from Scandinavia to E Siberia, except E Chukotsk ( Russia ), south to Sakhalin and Sikhote-Alin Mtns ( Russia ); Hokkaido ( Japan ); Heilungjiang, N Xinjiang ( China ); N Mongolia ; Altai, N Tien Shan Mtns; N Ukraine , E Poland , and Baltics; isolated populations in the Alps, Scotland , Wales and Ireland . Introduced into England , Faeros and Scottish Isis. STATUS: Populations fluctuate, but none apparently threatened, except perhaps in Alps ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: abet Kuroda, 1938 ; ainu Barrett-Hamilton, 1900 ; albus Leach, 1816; algidus Pallas, 1778; alpinus Erxleben, 1777 ; altaicus Barrett-Hamilton, 1900 ; begitschevi Koljuschev, 1936; borealis Pallas, 1778; breviauritus Hilzheimer, 1906; canescens Nilsson, 1844; collinus Nilsson, 1831; gichiganus J.

COMMENTS: Subgenus Lepus ( Gureev, 1964:180 ) . Formerly included arcticus and othus ; see Corbet (1978c:73) ; but also see comments under those species. A. J. Baker et al. (1983) found Scottish and Alpine populations morphologically distinct, as well as geographically isolated, from other populations, and Flux (1983) remarked that L. t. scoticus and L. t. hibernicus (from Scotland and Ireland , respectively), both introduced on the island of Mull ( Hewson, 1991 ) still do not interbreed after 50 years.
Lepus oiostolus Hodgson, 1840 . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 9:1186 . TYPE LOCALITY: " ...the snowy region of the Hemalaya, and perhaps also Tibet ." Restricted by Kao and Feng (1964), to "Southern Tibet " [ Xizang , China ] . DISTRIBUTION: Tibetan Plateau, from Ladak to Sikkim ( India ) Nepal , and eastward through Xizang ( Tibet ) and Qinghai , Gansu and Sichuan ( China ). STATUS: Probably secure, but may be affected by rodent control activity on Tibetan Plateau. SYNONYMS: grahami Howell, 1928 ; hypsibius Blanford, 1875; illuteus Thomas, 1914; kozlovi Satunin, 1907 ; oemodias Gray, 1847; pallipes Hodgson, 1842 ; przewalskii Satunin, 1907; qinghaiensis Cai and Feng, 1982 ; qusongensis Cai and Feng, 1982 ; sechuenensis de Winton, 1899 ; tsaidamensis Hilzheimer, 1910. COMMENTS: Placed in subgenus Proeulagus by Gureev (1964:196) ; przewalskii was assigned to capensis (= tolai ) by Corbet (1978c) , but is placed here following Cai and Feng (1982) ; Angermann (in litt., 1992) agreed with Corbet.
Lepus nigricollis F. Cuvier, 1823 . Diet. Sci. Nat., 26:307 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Malabar" [Madras, India ]. DISTRIBUTION: Pakistan ; India ; Bangladesh , except Sunderbands; Sri Lanka ; introduced into Java (?) and Mauritius , Gunnera Quoin, Anskya, Réunion and Cousin Isis in the Indian Ocean. Considered native to Java by McNeely (1981:931) . STATUS: Mainland (and Sri Lankan?) populations secure ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). If nigricollis is native to Java (rather than an introduced population), its numbers are now very low there. SYNONYMS: aryabertensis Hodgson, 1844 ; cutchensis Kloss, 1918 ; dayanus Blanford, 1874 ; joongshaiensis Murray, 1884 ; macrotus Hodgson, 1840 ; mahadeva Wroughton and Ryley, 1913 ; rajput Wroughton, 1917 ; ruficaudatus Geoffroy, 1826 ; sadiya Kloss, 1918; simcoxi Wroughton, 1912 ; singhala Wroughton, 1915; tytleri Tytler, 1854 . COMMENTS: Placed in Caprolagus (Indolagus) by Gureev (1964:139) . Includes ruficaudatus ; see Prater (1980) and Angermann (1983) , but see Gureev (1964: 142) ; ruficaudatus is closer to capensis according to Petter (1961), and nigricollis may include whytei, crawshayi , pequensis and siamensis; but also see comments under pequensis and saxatilis . Also includes dayanus , given specific status by Gureev (1964:139) .
Lepus othus Merriam, 1900 . Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 2:28 . TYPE LOCALITY: "St. Michaels, [Norton Sound], Alaska ." [ USA ]. DISTRIBUTION: W and SW Alaska ( USA ); formerly perhaps northwestward to Pt. Barrow; as here interpreted, also E Chukotsk ( Russia ). STATUS: Rare, perhaps decreasing in range and numbers ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: poadromus Merriam, 1900; tschuktschorum Nordquist, 1883. COMMENTS: Formerly included in arcticus or timidus (see comments therein). Regarded as distinct by Hall (1981) and by Flux and Angermann (1990) , who, however, followed A. J. Baker et al. (1983) in allying populations from E Chukotsk ( Russia ) with Alaskan populations; but see also Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Angermann (in litt., 1992) considered othus as "probably conspecific" with timidus .
Lepus granatensis Rosenhauer, 1856 . Die Thiere Andalusiens, 3 . TYPE LOCALITY: "bei Granada" [Granada, Analusia Prov., Spain ] . DISTRIBUTION: Iberian Peninsula, except NE and NC parts ( Spain , Portugal ); Mallorca (Balearic Isl, Spain ). STATUS: Generally common, but scarce or extinct in a few places. SYNONYMS: gallaecius Miller, 1907; hispanicus Fitzinger, 1867; iturissius, Miller, 1907; lilfordi de Winton, 1898; mediterraneus Wagner, 1841 ; meridionalis Graells, 1897; solisi Palacios and Fernändez, 1992 ; typicus Hilzheimer, 1906. COMMENTS: Formerly included in europaeus or capensis ; but see Palacios (1983,1989), and Bonhomme et al. (1986) . The Mallorcan population was probably introduced by humans ( Palacios and Fernândez, 1992 ). The population in Sardinia , to which the names mediterraneus Machado, 1869 (not mediterraneus Wagner, 1841 ) and typicus Hilzheimer, 1906, have been applied, is assigned to this species, but its status needs investigation, as do populations from the NW African coast that have been assigned to capensis (Angermann, in litt., 1992).
Lepus flavigularis Wagner, 1844 . In Schreber, Die Säugethiere ..., Suppl. 4:106 . TYPE LOCALITY: " Mexico " Restricted by Elliot (1905:543) to San Mateo del Mar, Tehuantepec [City, Oaxaca , Mexico ] . DISTRIBUTION: Coastal plains and bordering foothills on south end of Isthmus of Tehuantepec ( Oaxaca , Mexico ), along Pacific coast to Chiapas ( Mexico ); now restricted to small area between Salina Cruz, Oaxaca , and extreme W Chiapas . STATUS: IUCN - Endangered, by habitat destruction and overhunting. COMMENTS: Subgenus Proeulagus ( Gureev, 1964:193 ) . Closely related to callotis , with which it has an isolated allopatric distribution; see Anderson and Gaunt (1962) ; also see Hall (1981:330) .
Lepus hainanus Swinhoe, 1870 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1870:233 . TYPE LOCALITY: Hainan Island, "in the neighbourhood of the capital city" [ Hainan Province , China ] . DISTRIBUTION: Lowlands of Hainan Island. STATUS: Numbers reduced to extremely low levels by habitat alteration and overhunting, but no official status as yet conferred. SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Placed in Caprolagus (Indolagus) by Gureev (1964:146) . Considered a subspecies of pequensis by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) ; Flux and Angermann (1990) recommended provisional specific status, as did Gureev (1964) . Closely related to nigricollis (Angermann, in litt., 1992).
Lepus insularis W. Bryant, 1891 . Proc. California Acad. Sci., ser. 2, 3:92 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Espiritu Santo Island, [near La Paz], Gulf of California [ Baja California del Sur], Mexico ." DISTRIBUTION: Restricted to the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Rare. Occupies very small insular range, but population is stable, and seems in no danger ( Chapman et al., 1983 ). SYNONYMS: edwardsi Saint-Loup, 1895. COMMENTS: Subgenus Proeulagus ( Gureev, 1964:195 ) . Insular melanic allospecies, related to californicus ; see Hall (1981:328) and Dixon et al. (1983) .
Lepus mandshuricus Radde, 1861 . Melanges Biol. Acad. St. Petersbourg, 3:684 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Im Chy(Gebirge)" Bureya Mtns [ Khabarovsk Krai , Russia ] . DISTRIBUTION: Ussuri region ( Russia ); NE China ; extreme NE Korea . STATUS: Undetermined. SYNONYMS: melainus Li and Luo, 1979 ; melanonotus Ognev, 1922. COMMENTS: Distinct from brachyurus ; see Angermann (1966 , 1983 ); but placed in Caprolagus (Allolagus) brachyurus by Gureev (1964:150) ; followed by Gromov and Baranova (1981:63) . Melanic individuals known since at least the time of Sowerby (1923) have recently been given the specific designation melainus ( Li and Luo, 1979 ). The range of this taxon is entirely within that of mandshuricus , and I provisionally retain them in that species, although Flux and Angermann (1990) recognized melainus. L. mandshuricus and L. coreanus are parapatric in distribution in NE Korea /SE Heilungjiang, but are described as occupying different habitats; the former, mixed forest in hilly country, the latter, both forest and cultivated land, primarily in the plains ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). Moreover, mandshuricus is sympatric with another forest species, timidus , and with the plains species, tolai ; as forest is cleared, tolai tends to replace mandshuricus ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ) . L. mandshuricus , L. timidus and L. tolai all occur in the area occupied by the taxon melainus; four species of sympatric hares, three of them forest-dwellers, is unprecedented in hare ecology, and supports the view that melainus is not a distinct species.
Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778 . Nova Spec. Quad. Glir. Ord., p. 30 . TYPE LOCALITY: Not stated; restricted by Trouessart (1910) , to Poland (see discussion in Ognev, 1940:140 , which further restricts it to SW Poland ) . DISTRIBUTION: Open woodland, steppe and subdesert: from S Sweden and Finland to Britain, throughout Europe (not Iberian Penin, south of Cantabria and the Ebro R, or south of Siena in Italy ), to W Siberian lowlands; south to N Israel , N Syria , N Iraq , the Tigris-Euphrates valley and W Iran . SE border of range ( Iran ) from S Caspian Sea south to Persian Gulf ( 54°E ); see Angerman (1983:19).

COMMENTS: Subgenus Eulagos ( Gureev, 1964:205 ; Gromov and Baranova, 1981 ). This species was earlier placed in capensis by Petter (1961) based on what was interpreted as a cline in morphological characters (mainly size) from NE Africa eastward across the N Arabian peninsula and the Middle East, and northward through Israel to Turkey . Sympatry between large " europaeus " and small " capensis " (= tolai ) in Kazakhstan , without evidence of hybridization ( Sludskii et al., 1980 ) was interpreted as overlapping ends of a Rassenkreis. Angermann's (1983) reanalysis indicated a marked discontinuity between smaller capensis (incl. arabicus) and larger europaeus running from the E Mediterranean coast (C Israel ) through Iran , and on this basis we separate europaeus from capensis and tolai . East of the border of the range of europaeus in Iran , tolai occurs, apparently in allo- or parapatry with europaeus . Insular populations in the E Mediterranean are assigned to this species ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ).
Lepus corsicanus de Winton, 1898 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7,1:155 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Bastia," [ Corsica , Italy ]. DISTRIBUTION: Italy from the Abruzzo Mtns southward; Sicily ; introduced into Corsica no later than 16th Century ( Vigne, 1988 ). STATUS: Unknown, but probable reduction in numbers and range due to overhunting and introduction of L. europaeus ( Palacios et al., 1989 ) . SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Formerly included in capensis or europaeus ; see Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) and Petter (1961); but see also Palacios et al. (1989) who provided evidence of their specific distinctness.
Lepus fagani Thomas, 1903 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1902(2):315 [1903]. TYPE LOCALITY: "Zegi, Lake Tsana [Tana, Ethiopia ] 4000 feet ." DISTRIBUTION: N and W Ethiopia , and adjacent SE Sudan , south to extreme NW Kenya . STATUS: Unknown. SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Formerly included in victoriae (as crawshayi ) by Gureev (1964:204) ; AzzaroliPuccetti (1987a, b) maintained its specific identity. Its known distribution is largely allo- or parapatric to that of victoriae ; may be a highland allospecies ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). Angermann (in litt., 1992) considered fagani conspecific with victoriae .
Lepus castroviejoi Palacios, 1977 . Dofiana, Acta Vertebr., 1976, 3(2):205 [1977]. TYPE LOCALITY: "Puerto de la Ventana, San Emiliano (León [Province])" [= Puerto Ventana, Spain , 1500 m ] . DISTRIBUTION: Cantabrian Mtns between Sierra de Ancares and Sierra de Pena Labra (N Spain ). STATUS: Although it has a very restricted range ( 25-40 km by 230 km ), it is common in most places ( Palacios, 1983 ). SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Palacios (1983 , 1989) and Bonhomme et al. (1986) .

STATUS: Probably secure at present ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: peni Wang and Luo, 1985 ; pygmaeus Wang and Feng, 1985 . COMMENTS: Formerly included in oiostolus ; see Corbet (1978c) . Elevated to specific status by Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang et al. (1985) , on the basis of morphological and ecological differences. May be allo- or parapatric with oiostolus . Possibly related to nigricollis ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ) .
Lepus coreanus Thomas, 1892 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 6, 9:146 . TYPE LOCALITY: " Söul " [ Seoul ], Korea . DISTRIBUTION: Korea ; S Kirin, S Liaoning , E Heilungjiang ( China ). STATUS: Secure at present ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Formerly included in sinensis ( Corbet, 1978c ) or in brachyurus ( Kim and Kim, 1974 ) ; here considered distinct, following Flux and Angermann (1990) and Jones and Johnson (1965) . Angermann (in litt., 1992) suggested that coreanus and mandshuricus are conspecific.

COMMENTS: Subgenus Proeulagus ( Gureev, 1964:202 ) . Includes arabicus; formerly included europaeus , corsicanus , granatensis , and tolai ; see Corbet (1978c:71) , Angermann (1983:20) , and Harrison and Bates (1991) . Includes habessinicus , but see AzzaroliPuccetti (1987a, b) who considered habessinicus as distinct. The enigmatic form connori, often placed in capensis ( Corbet, 1978c ; Harrison and Bates, 1991 ) is provisionally placed in europaeus on the basis of pelage characteristics; see Angermann (1983:19) . Most Russian authors consider tolai (including tibetanus ) a distinct species; see Gromov and Baranova (1981:65) ; but also see Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987:229) . Sludskii et al. (1980:58 , 85) indicated an area of sympatry between europaeus and tolai in Kazakhstan . Sokolov and Orlov (1980:85) considered tibetanus a distinct species. Some Arabian forms may be specifically distinct ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ); Angermann (1983: 19) noted pronounced "size" groups within arabicus. These are arabicus (largest, gray), cheesmani (with insular atallahi) (smaller, buffy), and omanensis (with insular jeffreyi) (smallest, gray).
Caprolagus hispidus (Pearson, 1839) . In M'Clelland, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1838:152 [1839]. TYPE LOCALITY: "...Assam, ...base of the Boutan [ Bhutan ] mountains" [ India ] . DISTRIBUTION: S Himalaya foothills from Uttar Pradesh ( India ) through Nepal and West Bengal to Assam ( India ), and south through NW Bangladesh . Since 1951, there have been very few reports from Uttar Pradesh and Assam, see Santapau and Humayun (1960) , Mallinson (1971) , and Ghose (1978) . Presently known distribution summarized by Bell et al. (1990) . STATUS: CITES - Appendix I; U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered. SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Subgenus Caprolagus (see Gureev, 1964 ).

DISTRIBUTION: SC Arizona ( USA ) to N Nayarit and Tiburon Isl ( Mexico ). STATUS: Populations appear stable in Arizona, but in Mexico require investigation ( Flux and Angermann, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: palitans Bangs, 1900; tiburonensis Townsend, 1912. COMMENTS: Placed in Caprolagus (Macrotolagus) by Gureev (1964:155) . Probably related to callotis , but recognized as a distinct species by Hall (1981:331) .
Lepus Linnaeus, 1758 . Syst. Nat., 10th ed., 1:57 . TYPE SPECIES: Lepus timidus Linnaeus, 1758 .

COMMENTS: Formerly included Bunolagus ; see Petter (1972b) ; and originally all other genera except Pentalagus . The taxonomy of this genus remains controversial. L. crawshayi (including whytei), peguensis , ruficaudatus , and siamensis have been variously treated as separate species or have been included in nigricollis . L. europaeus , corsicanus , granatensis , tolai , and tibetanus have been placed in capensis or treated as distinct species; see comments therein.

Brachylagus idahoensis (Merriam, 1891) . N. Am. Fauna, 5:76 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Pahsimeroi Valley [near Goldburg, Custer County], Idaho ." [ USA ] . DISTRIBUTION: SW Oregon to EC California , SW Utah , N to SW Montana ( USA ). Isolated population in WC Washington ( USA ). STATUS: The status of the isolated Washington population is uncertain. Varies from secure to IUCN - Vulnerable depending upon population ( Chapman et al., 1990 ). SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Formerly included in Sylvilagus ; but see Corbet (1983) . Placed in the monotypic genus Brachylagus by Dawson (1967) and, together with bachmani , in the genus Microlagus by Gureev (1964:170-173) ; but also see Hall (1981:294) , who recognized Brachylagus as a subgenus. This species is widely sympatric with Sylvilagus nuttallii, and perhaps overlaps narrowly with S. audubonii. It has been interpreted as either a primitive rabbit ( Hibbard, 1963 ), or as derived from Sylvilagus ( Corbet, 1983 ). Reviewed by Green and Flinders (1980 , Mammalian Species, 125).
Prolagus sardus (Wagner, 1832) . Abh. Bayer. Akad. Wiss., 1:763 -767. TYPE LOCALITY: Italy , Sardinia .

Bunolagus monticularis (Thomas, 1903) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 7, 11:78 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Deelfontein, Cape Colony," South Africa . DISTRIBUTION: C Karoo ( 31°22'S , 22°E ), Cape Prov. ( South Africa ). STATUS: IUCN - Endangered. Now survives only in "dense, discontinuous karoid vegetation in the districts of Victoria West, Beaufort West and Frazerburg" ( 86km 2) ( Duthie and Robinson, 1990 ). SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Petter (1972b) . Formerly in Lepus ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ) , but returned to Bunolagus by Angermann (1966) . Karyological evidence supports the separation of Bunolagus (2n=44) from Lepus (2n=48) ( Robinson and Skinner, 1983 ; Robinson and Dippenaar, 1987 ); its closest relatives are probably Pronolagus ( Corbet, 1983 ) .
Ochotona rutila (Severtzov, 1873) . Izv. Obshch. Lyubit. Estestvozn., 8(2): 83 . TYPE LOCALITY: " ...in mountains near Vernyi [Alma-ata]... 7000-8000 ft.

DISTRIBUTION: Isolated ranges from the Pamirs ( Tadzhikistan ) to Ben Shan (SE Uzbezistan, Kirghizistan , SE Kazakhstan ); perhaps N Afghanistan and E Xinjiang ( China ). STATUS: This is a rare species, extremely sporadic in occurrence throughout its range, and common in only a few localities (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Apparently an allospecies of O. erythrotis , which has sometimes been included in rutila ; see comments therein.

COMMENTS: Includes angdawai and mitchelli, but not forresti and himalayana , which are here provisionally considered distinct; see comments therein. O. hodgsoni is traditionally placed here, but based on the original description may be assigned to nubrica .
Ochotona rufescens (Gray, 1842) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 10:266 . TYPE LOCALITY: " India , Cabul , Rocky Hills near Baker Tomb at about 6000 or 8000 feet elevation" [Baber's (?) Tomb, Kabul , Afghanistan ] . DISTRIBUTION: Afghanistan , Baluchistan ( Pakistan ), Iran , Armenia , and SW Turkmenia. STATUS: Considered a crop pest and controlled in parts of its range. However, most populations are not considered threatened. A possible exception may be the isolated population of shukurovi in the Little Balkhan Range, Turkmenia (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: regina Thomas, 1911; shukurovi Heptner, 1961 ; vizier Thomas, 1911; vulturna Thomas, 1920. COMMENTS: Includes seiana; see A. T. Smith et al. (1990) and comments under O. curzoniae .

COMMENTS: Formerly included cansus , forresti , and nubrica ; see comments therein. The taxon aliensis, originally described as a subspecies of thibetana , is now considered a synonym of nubrica ( Feng et al., 1986 ; A. T. Smith et al., 1990). O. osgoodi , described as a distinct species by Anthony (1941) , was listed as a subspecies of O. pusilla by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951) , and subsequently allocated to thibetana by Corbet (1978c) and Weston (1982) . The isolated subspecies sikimaria was assigned to cansus by Feng and Kao (1974) and Feng and Zheng (1985) , but transferred to thibetana by A. T. Smith et al. (1990). Erbaeva (1988: 190-191) considered cansus and sikimaria subspecies of thibetana , as well as lhasaensis, here placed in nubrica ; however, she thought hodgsoni was probably a distinct species (based on examination of a skull photograph).

DISTRIBUTION: Discontinuous in arid areas (mtns and high steppes) in Kazakhstan ; Altai Mtns, Tuva ( Russia ), and Mongolia , to Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia ( China ). STATUS: Isolated populations of O. p. hamica and O. p. sunidica are threatened, or in some cases may be extinct (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: hamica Thomas, 1912; ogotona Waterhouse, 1848 (not Bonhote, 1905); opaca Argyropulo, 1939 (not Vinogradov and Argyropulo, 1948 ; see Ellerman and MorrisonScott, 1951; not Argyropulo, 1941, see comment under gloveri kamensis ); pricei Thomas, 1911; sunidica Ma et al., 1980. COMMENTS: Includes pricei ( Corbet, 1978c ) as it is commonly referred to in Soviet literature. However, marked difference in reproduction, habitat, behavior, and vocalization suggest that pollasi and pricei may prove to be specifically distinct (A. T. Smith et al., 1990).
Ochotona nubrica Thomas, 1922 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 9:187 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Tuggur, Nubra Valley, alt. 10,000" [Ladak, Kashmir, India ] .

DISTRIBUTION: Steppes from middle Volga ( Russia ), east and south through N Kazakhstan to upper Irtysh River and Chinese border. Not yet recorded in China . STATUS: Disappearance from W end of its range within historic times was probably caused by elimination of preferred shrub-steppe habitat ( Kuz'mina, 1965 ). Some pop. are listed as rare in the "Red Book" of Bashkir Aut. Rep. (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: angustifrons Argyropulo, 1932; minutus Pallas, 1771 . COMMENTS: Formerly included nubrica (= lama), forresti , and osgoodi (a subspecies of thibetana ); see comments therein.
Ochotona ladacensis (Günther, 1875) . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 4, 16:231 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Chagra, 14000 feet above the sea" [Changra, Ladak, Kashmir, India ] .

STATUS: IUCN - Indeterminate. SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: This taxon was originally described as a subspecies of gloveri , but is now thought to be specifically distinct ( Feng and Zheng, 1985 ). It differs from gloveri in certain cranial characters, and in habitat (A. T. Smith et al., 1990), but its extreme rarity in collections makes its independent status difficult to demonstrate.

COMMENTS: Included in roylei by Gureev (1964) , Roberts (1977) , Corbet (1978c:68) , and Gromov and Baranova (1981:72) . Morphological and ecological differences in the area of sympatry first documented by Kawamichi (1971) and Abe (1971) , and confirmed by Mitchell (1978 , 1981). Weston (1982) , Feng and Zheng (1985) , and Feng et al. (1986) indicated that macrotis is a distinct species. Whether the co-type from "Doba" in the Natural History Museum (London) is from C Tibet or W Xinjiang is uncertain.

[Xigaze (Shigatse) County, Xizang ( Tibet ), China ]. DISTRIBUTION: Mt. Jolmolunga (Everest) area, S Xizang , China ; probably adjacent Nepal . STATUS: Unknown. SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: This taxon was considered a synonym of O. roylei by Corbet (1978c) and Weston (1982) . Additional data ( Feng and Zheng, 1985 ; Feng et al., 1986 ) suggest that it may be an independent species. However, its range is within that of the similar O. roylei nepalensis , and additional studies are necessary to confirm its specific distinctness.
Ochotona gaoligongensis Wang, Gong, and Duan, 1988 . Zool. Res., 9:201 , 206. TYPE LOCALITY: "Dongsao-fang [Mount Gaoligong], ( 27°45'N , 98°27'E ), Gongshan Co., Northwest Yunnan , alt. 2950 m ." [ China ]. DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: IUCN - Indeterminate. SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: From the original description, this taxon is likely to prove to be a synonym of O. forresti , which is known to occur in the same area.
Ochotona forresti Thomas, 1923 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., ser. 9, 11:662 . TYPE LOCALITY: "N.W. flank [Li-kiang Range, 27°N , 100°30'E ] 13,000’" ( Yunnan , China ] . DISTRIBUTION: NW Yunnan , SE Tibet ( China ); N Burma ; Assam , Sikkim ( India ); Bhutan . STATUS: Unknown. SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Formerly included in pusilla ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ) , roylei ( Corbet, 1978c ) , and thibetana ( Feng and Kao, 1974 ; Gureev, 1964 ; Weston, 1982 ), but now considered distinct (A. T. Smith et al., 1990, and references therein). O. forresti is poorly known, but may prove to be an allospecies of O. roylei ; it is thought to be geographically sympatric with O. gloveri and/or O. thibetana in Yunnan ( China ), Burma , and Sikkim ( India ).

COMMENTS: Formerly incuded in alpina ; see A. T. Smith et al. (1990), and references therein. Difference in morphology and vocalizations are noticeable where hyperborea and alpina are sympatric in the W Sayan Mtns, Khangai Mtns, and Transbaikalia, and character displacement in size is also evident in some populations (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). The original citation was printed and privately circulated in 1811, but not published for general distribution until 1826.
Ochotona collaris (Nelson, 1893) . Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington , 8:117 . TYPE LOCALITY: "about 200 miles south of Fort Yukon, Alaska near the head of the Tanana River." [ USA ]. DISTRIBUTION: WC Mackenzie, S Yukon , NW British Columbia ( Canada ); SE Alaska ( USA ). STATUS: Not significantly threatened ( MacDonald and Jones, 1987 ). SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Broadbooks (1965) and Youngman (1975) considered collaris and princeps conspecific. Corbet (1978c) , following Argyropulo (1948) and Gureev (1964) , included collaris in alpina . A statistical réévaluation of craniometric data by Weston (1981) indicated that collaris , princeps and alpina are separate species; Hall (1981:286) also recognized collaris as a distinct species. O. collaris and O. princeps share similar chromosome numbers that differ sharply from those of alpina and hyperborea ( Vorontsov and Ivanitskaya, 1973 ) .

Ochotona curzoniae (Hodgson, 1858) . J. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 1857, 26:207 [1858]. TYPE LOCALITY: "district of Chumbi", Chumbi Valley, Tibet , China . DISTRIBUTION: Tibetan Plateau; adjacent Gansu , Qinghai , Sichuan ( China ), Sikkim ( India ) and E Nepal . STATUS: This species is the focus of widespread control efforts throughout its range, and has been eliminated locally (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: melanostoma ( Büchner, 1890 ) . COMMENTS: Includes melanostoma , but not seiana from Iran , contra Corbet (1978c:69) ; see A. T. Smith et al. (1990). Treated as a subspecies of dauurica by Mitchell (1978) , but it is considered a distinct species by the Chinese; see Feng and Zheng (1985) and Feng et al. (1986) . O. curzoniae and O. dauurica occur in geographic sympatry in Hainan County, Qinghai Province , China , and differ both chromosomally ( Vorontsov and Ivanitskaya, 1973 ) and electrophoretically ( Zhou and Xia, 1981 ).
Ochotona dauurica (Pallas, 1776) . Reise Prov. Russ. Reichs., 3:692 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Vivit in campis, montiumque declivibus arenosis apricis, per totam Dauuriam ... " Restricted by Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1951:452) to "Kulusutai, Onon River, Eastern Siberia" [Chitinsk. Obi. Russia ]. DISTRIBUTION: Steppes from Altai , Tuva , and Transbaikalia ( Russia ) through N China and Mongolia , south to Qinghai Province , China . STATUS: Considered a pest, is intensively controlled in China ; control in Russia has been much less intensive. Isolated populations around the margins of the Gobi Desert in China and Mongolia are very vulnerable (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: altaina Thomas, 1911; annectens Miller, 1911; bedfordi Thomas, 1908; minor Link, 1795 ; mursavi Bannikov, 1951. COMMENTS: The spelling of dauurica conforms to that of the original description. Formerly included curzoniae and melanostoma ; see curzoniae . Ellerman and Morrison-Scott's type restriction is dubious because modern Kulusutai is south of the Onon River, at the NE end of Lake Baron-Torei. See Ognev (1940:62) and Allen (1938:551) for alternate type localities in the same general area.
Ochotona erythrotis (Büchner, 1890) . Wiss. Result. Przewalski Cent . Asien Reisen. Zool. Th., B. I: Säugeth., p. 165 .

STATUS: Indeterminate. SYNONYMS: vulpina Howell, 1928. COMMENTS: Formerly included gloveri ; see Corbet (1978c:68) . Feng and Zheng (1985) provided evidence that gloveri (including brookei) is a distinct species. Formerly included in rutila ( Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ) , but now regarded as distinct ( Feng and Zheng, 1985 ; Weston, 1982 ). The distribution of this species is poorly known, as are its relationships with the apparently allopatric rutila , iliensis , and gloveri .

COMMENTS: There are presently no grounds for recognizing subgenera pending a phylogenetic analysis of specific relationships within the genus. The subgeneric classifications published (e.g., Allen, 1938 ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Erbaeva, 1988; Ognev, 1940 ) differ dramatically, even when based on the same distinguishing characteristics.
Family Ochotonidae Thomas, 1897 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1896:1026 [1897]. SYNONYMS: Lagomina Gray, 1825 ; Lagomyidae Lilljeborg, 1866 .

DISTRIBUTION: Sayan and Altai Mtns; Khangai, Kentei and associated ranges; upper Amur drainage (NW Kazakhstan , S Russia , NW Mongolia); N Kansu-Ningsia border ( China ). STATUS: The small isolated population of O. a. argentata at the southern extreme of the species range is likely endangered, and other isolated montane populations in Mongolia may be threatened (A. T. Smith et al., 1990). SYNONYMS: argentata Howell, 1928 ; ater Eversmann, 1842 ; changaica Ognev, 1940 ; cinereofusca (Schrenk, 1858); nitida Hollister, 1912 ; scoroduntovi Skalon, 1935; sushkini Thomas, 1924. COMMENTS: Formerly included hyperborea ; but see Ivanitskaya (1985) and Pavlinov and Rossolimo (1987) . Sokolov and Orlov (1980:79) considered hyperborea a distinct species with a distribution overlapping that of alpina in the Khangai and Kentei Mtns, Mongolia . Separate specific status was supported by differences in chromosome numbers ( Vorontsov and Ivanitskaya, 1973 ). The race sushkini , formerly assigned to O. pallosi , is a subspecies of alpina (see A. T. Smith et al., 1990, and references therein). Does not include collaris or princeps , see Weston (1981) .
Ochotona cansus Lyon, 1907 . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 50:136 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Taocheo, Kan-su , China " [Lintan, Gannan A.D., Gansu , China ] . DISTRIBUTION: C China ( Gansu , Qinghai , Sichuan ); isolated populations in Shaanxi and Shanxi . STATUS: The Shanxi subspecies sorella , isolated in the extreme northwest of the species range, may be extinct. It is known from only a few specimens, and has not been found in over 50 years. SYNONYMS: morosa Thomas, 1912; sorella Thomas, 1908 ; stevensi Osgood, 1932 . COMMENTS: Büchner (1890) originally included this species in the quite different O. roylei , but in recent years it has usually been assigned to O. thibetana ( Allen, 1938 ; Argyropulo, 1948 ; Corbet, 1978c ; Ellerman and Morrison-Scott, 1951 ; Gureev, 1964 ; Honacki et al., 1982 ; Weston, 1982 ). Recent studies showed that cansus and thibetana are broadly sympatric, with distinct ecological niches, and morphological characters that do not intergrade ( Feng and Kao, 1974 ; Feng and Zheng, 1985 ). The latter authors, without access to holotypes , assigned the race morosa to thibetana , but it is an isolated subspecies of cansus that is sympatric with O. thibetana in the Tsing Ling Shan , Shaanxi Province (A. T. Smith et al., 1990, and references therein).
Sylvilagus transitionalis (Bangs, 1895) . Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist., 26:405 . TYPE LOCALITY: "Liberty Hill, Conn." [New London Co., Connecticut , USA ] .

STATUS: Range, especially in north, has been much reduced, probably by habitat alteration and subsequent displacement by S. floridanus ( Chapman and Ceballos, 1990 ) . SYNONYMS: Monotypic. COMMENTS: Subgenus Sylvilagus ( Gureev, 1964:166 ) . Two cytotypes are known; northern (2n=52) and southern (2n=46)( Holden and Eabry, 1970 ; Robinson et al., 1983); and may require recognition of a new species ( Ruedas, 1986 ).

Pecari Reichenbach, 1835 . Bildergalerie der Thierwelt, part 6, p. 1 . TYPE SPECIES: Dicotyles torquatus Cuvier, 1816 (= Sus tajacu Linnaeus, 1758 ). SYNONYMS: Notophorus . COMMENTS: The Collared Peccary should be assigned to a separate genus from the Whitelipped species according to Woodburne (1968) , Husson (1978:347-348) , and Wright (1989) . Use of appropriate generic names for these taxa is controversial. Genotypes of Tayassu and Dicotyles by subsequent designation are White-lipped Peccaries, see Miller and Rehn (1901:12) , and Miller (1912b:384) , so the correct generic name for Collared Peccaries appears to be Pecari, with type by monotypy Dicotyles torquatus.

COMMENTS: By subsequent designation, the type of Tayassu is T. pecari Fischer, 1814 (= Sus pecari Link, 1795 ); see Miller and Rehn (1901:12) . By subsequent designation, the type of Dicotyles is D. labiatus G. Cuvier ; see Miller (1912b:384) . Sus pecari and Dicotyles labiatus are synonyms of Tayassu pecari ; see Hershkovitz (1963) . Therefore, Dicotyles is a synonym of Tayassu , but see Husson (1978:347-348) and Woodburne (1968) for contrary views.

Subfamily Heteropsomyinae Anthony, 1917 . Bull. Am. Mus . Nat. Hist., 37(4):189 . COMMENTS: Named by Anthony to reflect perceived relationship between Heteropsomys and Dasyprocta . Expanded by Kraglievich (1965) and Patterson and Pascual (1968b) to include Proechimys and associate genera. Modified by Woods (1982:386) when West Indian Spiny Rats classified with capromyids. West Indian Spiny Rats are transitional in characters between Echimyidae and Capromyidae , and here are placed in their own subfamily within the Echimyidae until the two families are revised. Varona (1974:73) placed all West Indian Spiny Rats in the genus Heteropsomys . However, there are clear differences between the forms on each island, so the original generic names are maintained here, except that Homopsomys is combined with Heteropsomys ( Woods, 1989a , b).

Included in Capromys by Mohr (1939:75) , Varona (1974:67) , Hall (1981:865) , and Corbet and Hill (1991:203) . However, considered a distinct genus by Miller (1929) , Woods and Howland (1979:112) , and Morgan (1985:30) . Includes columbianus, pleistocenicus (see Hall, 1981:866 ), and megas (see Varona and Arredondo, 1979:12; Silva and Garrido, in press), which are known only from Holocene fossils from Cuba .
Capromys pilorides (Say, 1822) . Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 2:333 . TYPE LOCALITY: "South America or one of the West Indian islands." DISTRIBUTION: Mainland Cuba , Isle of Youth, Archipiélago de las Doce Legunas, Archipiélago de Sabana, and many other islands and cays in the Cuban archipelago. STATUS: Common (extremely abundant in some areas, including Guantanamo Bay Naval Base). SYNONYMS: acevedo , doceleguas, gundlachianus, intermedius, pilorides , relictus. COMMENTS: The first mention of this species name is as Mus pilorides Pallas 1778 , however, Tate (1935:309) noted that it is not associated with this genus. Sometimes placed in the subgenus Capromys ; see Hall (1981:863) . This species is very variable in size, coloration, and habits. There are four named subspecies (doceleguas, gundlachianus, pilorides , and relictus; see Varona, 1983a:77 ), and one new subspecies currently being described from the south of the Isle of Youth (Borroto and Camacho, in litt.). Macrocapromys acevedo described by Arredondo (1958:10) is not distinct at the generic level, and is probably synonymous with pilorides.
Capromys Desmarest, 1822 . Bull. Sci. Soc. Philom. Paris, p. 185 . TYPE SPECIES: Capromys fournieri Desmarest, 1822 (= Isodon pilorides Say, 1822 ). SYNONYMS: Macrocapromys . COMMENTS: " Capromys " geayi (Pousarges, 1899) was described from Venezuela , where it was collected in the mountains between La Guayra and Caracas. It was placed in its own genus (Procapromys) by Chapman (1901:322) . The type specimen is Mus. Nat. Hist. Nat. (Paris) No. 1898-1785 (1834A). No further specimens have ever been collected, and it is probable that the collecting locality was incorrectly recorded. This specimen is likely a juvenile Capromys from Cuba erroneously reported from Venezuela .
Family Capromyidae Smith, 1842 . The Naturalist's Library (London), 15:308 . COMMENTS: Does not include Myocastor , and apparently represents an entirely intra­Caribbean radiation ( Woods and Howland, 1979 ; Woods 1989a , b); also see comments under Myocastoridae . Woods (1982:386-387) included West Indian Heteropsomyinae in this family, but here this group is assigned to the Echimyidae (see comments under Heteropsomyinae ). Varona (1974) and Corbet and Hill (1991:203) classified most of the following species in either of two genera ( Capromys or Plagiodontia ), whereas Woods (1989a , b) separated them into several distinct subfamilies and genera.
Subfamily Capromyinae Smith, 1842 . The Naturalist's Library (London), 15:30 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Kratochvil et al. (1978) , Varona and Arredondo (1979), and Silva and Garrido (in press). The status of Brachycapromys , Mysateles , Mesocapromys , Pygmaeocapromys, Paracaprontys and Stenocapromys as genera or subgenera is unresolved ( Hall, 1981 ; Rodriguez et al., 1979 ; Silva and Garrido, in press; Woods and Howland, 1979 ). This group is in need of revision to standardize the taxonomic levels proposed for the Cuban radiation of capromyids with taxonomic categories established for Hispaniola. Until the group is revised, the Cuban capromyids are placed in three genera as accepted by the majority of Cuban systematists (Capromys, Mesocapromys , Mysateles). In addition to the extant forms described below, 13 extinct forms of Capromys-like hutias have been described (Silva and Garrido, in press; Varona and Arredondo, 1979): Capromys antiquus, C. arredondoi, C. latus, C. pappus, C. robustus, Mesocapromys barbouri, M. beatrizae, M. delicatus, M. gracilis, M. kraglievichi, M. minimus, M. silvai, and Mysateles jaumei. Some of these were described in separate subgenera (i.e. Pygmaeocapromys, Brachycapromys, Palaeocapromys), but the arrangement in Silva and Garrido (in press) is followed until a revision of the family is completed.
Mesocapromys nanus (G. M. Allen, 1917) . Proc. New England Zool. Club, 6:54 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cuba , Matanzas Prov. , Sierra de Hato Nuevo . DISTRIBUTION: Cienaga (swamp) de Zapata ( Matanzas Prov. , Cuba ). STATUS: U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered. Some mammalogists consider this species to be extinct since no specimens have been collected since 1937, but it is still likely to survive in remote areas of the Zapata Swamp (Jorge de la Cruz, pers. comm.). COMMENTS: Placed in newly created subgenus Pygmaeocapromys by Varona (1979:5). In genus Mesocapromys , subgenus Paracapromys by Kratochvil et al. (1978:15) , and Rodriguez et al. (1979) . However, retained in Capromys subgenus Mysateles by Hall (1981:863) because of its long tail and small body size. Varona (1979:5), however, stated that even though this species "automatically" is associated with Mysateles because of tail length, there are important cranial differences between nanus and other Mysateles . Originally based on fossil material, but subsequently found living in the Zapata Swamp.

Morgan (1985) reconfirmed its status as a distinct species. Clough (1976) stated that thoracatus became extinct in 1950s, possibly as a result of introduced cats on the island. Reviewed by Morgan (1989, Mammalian Species, 341).
Mesocapromys auritus (Varona, 1970) . Poeyana, ser. A, 73:1 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cuba , Las Villas Prov., Archipiélago de Sabana, Cayo Fragoso ( 22°41'N , 79O27'W) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from the type locality. STATUS: U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered. COMMENTS: This form is known only from mangrove habitats along the edges of canals passing across Cayo Fragoso. This form constructs nests that are very similar to those of angelcabrerai .
Mesocapromys angelcabrerai (Varona, 1979) . Poeyana, 194:6 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cuba , Ciego de Avila Prov. , Cayos de Ana Maria ( 21°30'N , 78°40'W ) . DISTRIBUTION: Cayos de Ana Maria, Cuba . STATUS: U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered. COMMENTS: Placed in the subgenus Pygmaeocapromys by Varona (1979:5). Unusual among capromyines in being sexually dimorphic. There are reports of the presence of M. angelcabrerai on the coast near Jucaró, but no confirmed specimens are known. This species and M. nanus are the two smallest hutias in Cuba .
Mesocapromys Varona, 1970 . Poeyana, 73:8 . TYPE SPECIES: Capromys (Mesocapromys) auritus Varona, 1970 . SYNONYMS: Paracapromys, Pygmaeocapromys, Stenocapromys . COMMENTS: Original use of name was as a subgenus, which was elevated to a genus by Kratochvil et al. (1978:15) . All members of this genus are small (less than 1 kg ), and construct large nests made of sticks, unlike Mysateles .
Mysateles gundlachi (Chapman, 1901) . Bull. Am. Mus . Nat. Hist., 14:313 -323. TYPE LOCALITY: "Nueva Gerona, Isle of Pines" (now Isle of Youth or Isla de la Juventud ) . DISTRIBUTION: N regions of Isle of Youth (south of W Cuba ). STATUS: IUCN - Indeterminate. Abundant in specific forest types at several areas in the north of the Isle of Youth, but rapid deforestation of the area is making this species increasingly uncommon, and perhaps threatened (A. Camacho, pers. comm.). COMMENTS: Raised to specific level by Varona (1986:7) . Closely related to Mysateles prehensilis . It is proposed that there are two prehensile-tailed tree hutias on the Isle of Youth. According to Varona (1986) , this species is confined to forested areas of Roystones regia, Colpothrinax wrightii , and Copernicia curtissi north of the central savanna of the island, and M. meridionalis is confined to completely different forest types on the southwest side of the island south of the savanna. Mysateles gundlachi is described on the basis of the baculum, which is distinctly broad-based unlike that of M. meridionalis ; see also comments under meridionalis and prehensilis .
Mysateles garridoi (Varona, 1970) . Poeyana, ser. A, 74: 2 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cuba , Archipiélago de los Canarreos, "Cayo Majâ" . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from a single specimen (type locality). STATUS: IUCN - Endangered. COMMENTS: Placed in the genus Mysateles , subgenus Leptocapromys by Kratochvil et al. (1978:15) . However, retained in Capromys by Varona (in litt.). The type locality has been clarified by Silva and Garrido (in press), who identified the correct name for the locality as a yet unnamed small cay adjacent to Cayo Largo in the Archipiélago de los Canarreos. Varona (1970) incorrectly applied the name Cayo Majâ to this islet. It is known that this hutia does not occur on the adjacent Cayo Majâ (three cays to the northwest of the Cayo Largo) based on a 1990 expedition to this region by R. Borroto (pers. comm.). The single known specimen may have been left on the site where it was collected by fishermen, and not be from the area, so it is necessary to search more widely in the region to determine the status of this species (A. Camacho, pers. comm.).
Mesocapromys sanfelipensis (Varona and Garrido, 1970) . Poeyana, ser. A, 75:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cuba , Pinar del Rio Prov. , Archipiélago de los Canarreos, Cayo Juan Garcia ( 21°59'N , 83O31'W) . DISTRIBUTION: Known only from four specimens collected at the type locality. STATUS: U.S. ESA and IUCN - Endangered. The species is now considered to be extinct because a fire destroyed much of its habitat on Cayo Juan Garcia ( Frias et al., 1988 ). COMMENTS: Placed in subgenus Mesocapromys by Varona (1974) , and in genus Mesocapromys , subgenus Paracapromys by Kratochvil et al. (1978:15) . The habitat of this species is uncertain, but all known specimens were captured in grasslands (Salicornia perennis = "yerba de vidrio") rather than mangroves.
Mysateles Lesson, 1842 . Nouv. Tabi. Regne Animal, Mammifères, p, 124 . TYPE SPECIES: Capromys prehensilis Poeppig, 1824 . SYNONYMS: Brachycapromys, Leptocapromys . COMMENTS: Lesson separated Capromys prehensilis as Mysateles poeppingi ; see Varona (1979:4-5). Kratochvil et al. (1978: 15) treated Mysateles as a genus in their new classification. Mysateles was included in Capromys by Woods (1989a:781) , Hall (1981:863) , and Corbet and Hill (1991:203) . Cuban systematists universally accept Mysateles as a valid genus, and there is biochemical and morphological evidence to support this (A. Camacho, pers. comm.). Mysateles is recognized here as a distinct genus until a review of all Capromyidae is completed to establish how much intraisland variation is required for recognition of taxa at the generic level.
Mysateles melanurus (Poey, 1865) . In Peters, 1865, Monatsb. K. Preuss. Akad. Wiss. Berlin, p. 384 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cuba , Manzanillo, Gramma Prov. (Oriente region) . DISTRIBUTION: E provinces of Cuba . STATUS: IUCN - Rare. Locally abundant in Giiisa, Gramma Prov., but uncommon in other regions of the eastern provinces (A. Camacho, pers. comm.). SYNONYMS: arboricolus. COMMENTS: The author and date of publication for this species are usually given as Peters, 1864, but Varona (1974:63) , established the correct author and date as Poey, 1865. Includes arboricolus of Kratochvil et al. (1978:48) , who placed it in the genus Mysateles , subgenus Leptocapromys. However, this specimen is considered to be a young female C. melanurus by Varona (1986:7) . I have examined the specimen, and concur with Varona.
Aconaemys fuscus (Waterhouse, 1842) . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1841:91 [1842]. TYPE LOCALITY: Argentina , Mendoza Prov. , Valle de las Cuevas; see comments . DISTRIBUTION: High Andes of Chile and Argentina (between 33° and 41°S ). STATUS: Locally abundant. SYNONYMS: porteri. COMMENTS: Waterhouse never designated a type species, which was finally designated as a lectotype by Thomas (1917a) . Waterhouse's original type locality was "from Chile ", but in 1848 he added that the locality was from the Valle de las Cuevas near the Volcano of Peteroa, which would make the locality in Argentina ( Pearson, 1984 ). These complications make it difficult to evaluate the status of the following species. The chromosome no. is 2n=56.

(E Argentina ), possibly to Santa Fe Prov. SYNONYMS: antonii. COMMENTS: Possibly a subspecies of mendocinus (Cabrera, 1961:556) . The chromosome no. is 2n=46-50.
Ctenomys torquatus Lichtenstein, 1830 . Darst. Säugeth., text of pl. 31 . TYPE LOCALITY: Brazil , S provinces, and banks of Uruguay River. See Moojen (1952:188) . DISTRIBUTION: Uruguay , NE Argentina , extreme S Brazil . COMMENTS: Considered a distinct species by Ellerman (1940: 167) and Novak (1991:939); but see Cabrera (1961:547) who provisionally included it in brasiliensis . According to Redford and Eisenberg (1992) , the chromosome no. is 2n=56-70, indicating the group is probably a superspecies, although Reig et al. (19906) reported a chromosome no. of 2n=44-46.
Family Octodontidae Waterhouse, 1840 . Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1839:172 [1840]. SYNONYMS: Spalacopidae. COMMENTS: Includes Spalacopidae Lilljeborg, 1866. Sometimes considered the most primitive group of South American hystricognaths with numerous fossil genera from Oligocene on, but Reig (1986:418) reserved this distinction for the Echimyidae . Ctenomys is often placed here as subfamily, and is closely related to octodontids (see comments under Ctenomyidae and in Cook et al., 1990:22-23 ). Chromosomal variation is not as conservative as previously thought, and is 2n=38-102.
Aconaemys Ameghino, 1891 . Rev. Argent. Hist. Nat., 1:245 . TYPE SPECIES: Schizodon fuscus Waterhouse, 1842 . COMMENTS: Reig (1986:408) noted that Aconaemys is not separable from the Pliocene/ Pleistocene form Pithanotomys Ameghino, 1887 at the generic level. If indeed the two are not separable, Pithanotomys would have priority as a name over Acomaemys.

COMMENTS: See Oliver and Santos (1991) for a discussion of the confusion surrounding the distribution of this species.
Subfamily Dactylomyinae Tate, 1935 . Bull. Am. Mus . Nat. Hist., 68:295 . COMMENTS: Reig (1986:409) questioned placement of this subfamily in Echimyidae , and raised the possibility that dactylomyines are capromyids. If West Indian Spiny Rats are placed in Capromyidae (see Woods, 1982 ) then dactylomyines might be too, but here the West Indian forms are left in Echimyidae in their own subfamily (see comment under Heteropsomyinae ).

COMMENTS: Husson (1978:451) reserved the use of porcellus to denote domesticated guinea pigs, which are probably derived from tschudii ( Corbet and Hill, 1991:201 ) , but also see Hiickinghaus (1961:96), who regarded porcellus as a synonym of aperea . This species may be a domesticated animal with no established wild population. K. F. Koopman (pers. comm.) believes that N South American populations may be feral domestic guinea pigs; but see comment under aperea .

Family Ctenomyidae Lesson, 1842 . Nouv. Tabi. Règne Animal., Mamm., p. 105 . COMMENTS: This assemblage of 56 named species is in need of revision. The species are variable in chromosome number, but fairly uniform in morphology, suggesting that the major radiation of species was in the Pleistocene ( Roig and Reig, 1969:666 ; Reig et al. (19906:89). Ctenomys is most closely allied to the octodontid Octodontomys . Whether the group should be recognized as a subfamily (Ctenomyinae, Reig, 1958 ), or as a family is debated. Although the designation of subfamily within the Octodontidae best reflects the evolutionary history of the group, it is more common to treat the group as a distinct family specialized for fossorial life. Glanz and Anderson (1990) gave a cladogram and list of synapomorphies for the Ctenomyidae . Here 39 species are recognized. Reig (1986:408) stated that his analysis indicated there may be 44 valid species. See Reig et al. (19906) for an overview of ctenomyid taxonomy, and Cook et al. (1990:22-24) for a discussion of the possible significance of the extensive chromosomal variation in Ctenomys and octodontids (2n=10-102), which is nearly as great as the known variation for all mammals.

As Cuniculus is unavailable (see comments under Agouti ), Agoutidae is the proper familial name.

Family Bathyergidae Waterhouse, 1841 . Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., [ser. 1], 8:81 . COMMENTS: Reviewed by Honeycutt et al. (1991) . The family has been traditionally divided into two subfamilies: Bathyerginae with grooved upper incisors ( Bathyergus ); and Georychinae with ungrooved upper incisors ( Cryptomys , Georychus , Heliophobius, Heterocephalis ). Honeycutt et al. (1991:59) did not support such groupings.
SUBORDER HYSTRICOGNATHI SYNONYMS: Hystricomorpha. COMMENTS: Originally used as a tribe (Tribus) by Tullberg under his Order Glires, Suborder Simplicidentati , the first time this natural group was united together without various hystricomorphous forms. Includes Hystricidae, Thryonomyoidea, Bathyergoidea , "Caviomorpha", and the Eocene-Oligocene Franimorpha. The term "Caviomorpha" is inappropriate since it is unlikely all New World forms are part of a single radiation, and the Caviidae are the least characteristic family of the group, so it is best to refer to these collectively as the New World hystricognaths, and discuss them in their superfamily groupings (Chinchilloidea, Cavioidea, Erethizontoidea, and Octodontoidea). See Tullberg (1899:69-71) and Wood (1985:478-495) for definitions of hystricognath characters and lists of taxa.

Sphiggurus F. Cuvier, 1825 . Dentes des Mammifères, p. 256 . TYPE SPECIES: Hystrix spinosa F. Cuvier, 1823 . SYNONYMS: Cercolabes, Sinoetherus. COMMENTS: This genus possibly dates from F. Cuvier, 1823. Mém Mus. Hist. Nat. Paris., 9:427, 433-435, where Sphiggurus seems only a French name "Sphiggure" except on pp. 433-434, where it is abbreviated "S. spinosa ". Formerly included in Coendou by Cabrera (1961:600), Walker et al. (1975:1012) , and Hall (1981:853) ; see also comments under Coendou . Considered a distinct genus by Husson (1978:484-490) , Woods (1984) , and Nowak (1991) . Emmons and Feer (1990:201) recognized Coendou [ Sphiggurus ] sneiderni, the White-fronted Hairy Dwarf Porcupine, from Cauca Department of Colombia , which is apparently known from only one specimen , but this species is not recognized here, and is tentatively placed in the synonymy of Echinoprocta following Cabrera (1961).

Viscaccia Oken, 1816 has precedence over Lagidium , but Lagidium was adopted in preference to Viscaccia by suspension of the Rules (Opinion 110, International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, 1929a ). However, names from Oken's 1916 "Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte" are non-Linnaean and not available (Hershkovitz, 19496:289) and neither an opinion nor suspension of the Rules was required for the recognition of Lagidium (Hershkovitz, 19496:296).

Formerly included in Coendou ; see Husson (1978) and comment under Sphiggurus . Emmons and Feer (1990:200) considered the correct species name to be paragayensis Oken, 1816, which does predate Cuvier's name, but Cabrera (1961:602) noted that Oken's names are not recognized. If Oken's name is accepted, then the type species for Sphiggurus becomes paragayensis (see Tate, 1935:307).

Cavia Pallas, 1766 . Mise. Zool., p. 30 . TYPE SPECIES: Cavia cobaya Pallas, 1766 (= Mus porcellus Linnaeus, 1758 ). SYNONYMS: Anoema, Cobaya. COMMENTS: Reviewed by Hiickinghaus (1961) and Cabrera (1961). See Tate (1935:343) for the reason porcellus is "excluded from consideration" as the type because the name was not included under the generic name at the time of its original publication.

COMMENTS: Includes guianae; see Hiickinghaus (1961:58) and Husson (1978:449) ; but also see Cabrera (1961:578) who placed guianae in porcellus . Corbet and Hill (1991:201) listed guianae as a distinct species without comment. Includes pamparum according to Massoia and Fornes (1967) and Hiickinghaus (1961:57), but Cabrera (1961:577) listed pamparum as a distinct species. Also includes nana (see Hiickinghaus, 1961:58).
Isolobodon montanus (Miller, 1922) . Smithson. Mise. Coll., 74:3 . TYPE LOCALITY: Haiti , Dept, de l'Artibonite, Cave NE of Saint Michel de l'Atalaye . DISTRIBUTION: Hispaniola and La Gonave Island. STATUS: Extinct. COMMENTS: Originally described in a separate genus from I. portoricensis because the enamel folds of the cheekteeth connect to form separate laminar plates, but a large series of each species indicates that this character is clinal, and that the two forms are very closely related.
Mysateles prehensilis (Poeppig, 1824) . Jour. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia, 4:11 . TYPE LOCALITY: Cuba , wooded south coast . DISTRIBUTION: Cuba , mainly west of Camagüey Province . The status of this species in the eastern provinces (old Oriente Prov.) is not clear. STATUS: Common. SYNONYMS: poeyi, poeppingi , pallidus . COMMENTS: Placed in the subgenus Mysateles by Mohr (1939:54) and Varona (1974) , and in the genus and subgenus Mysateles by Kratochvil et al. (1978:15) . This is the largest species of Mysateles ; see comments under gundlachi and meridionalis .

COMMENTS: Includes H. poolei ( Rimoli, 1976:21 ) , which is known only by the type specimen (USNM No. 255881), because the normal dental variation of H. phenax includes the diagnostic condition in H. poolei .
Mysateles meridionalis (Varona, 1986) . Poeyana, 315:4 . TYPE LOCALITY: North of Caleta Cocodrilos, southwestern Isla de la Juventud (former Isle of Pines) . DISTRIBUTION: Restricted to lowland forests SW of the central savanna of the Isle of Youth (south of W Cuba ). STATUS: IUCN - Indeterminate; but probably very uncommon. COMMENTS: Closely related to Mystateles prehensilis and M. gundlachi , but different in the proportion of the tail which is 62 percent of body length in meridionalis , 73 percent in gundlachi , and 79 percent in prehensilis ; see also comments under gundlachi and prehensilis .

Family Heptaxodontidae Anthony, 1917 . Bull. Am. Mus . Nat. Hist., 37(4):183 . SYNONYMS: Amblyrhizinae, Elasmodontomyinae. COMMENTS: Known only from sub-Recent fossils from Greater and N Lesser Antilles ( Woods, 1989a ). It is debated whether Amblyrhiza and Clidomys became extinct before or after humans arrived in the West Indies. This family is often placed near the Chinchillidae based on similar laminar plates of molariform teeth. One genus ( Quemisia ) is very similar in dental morphology to capromyids, however, and it is possible to derive all of the conditions seen in heptaxodontids from dental patterns found within the Capromyidae . This family should be placed adjacent to the Capromyidae .
Plagiodontia aedium F. Cuvier, 1836 . Ann. Sci. Nat. Zool. (Paris), ser. 2, 6:347 . TYPE LOCALITY: " Saint-Domingue " (probably Haiti ) . DISTRIBUTION: Hispaniola, La Gonave Island, not recorded from La Tortue island. STATUS: IUCN - Rare. SYNONYMS: hylaeum, spelaeum. COMMENTS: Includes hylaeum as a separate subspecies (Anderson, 1965).

DISTRIBUTION: Hispaniola. STATUS: Extinct. SYNONYMS: stenocoronalis . COMMENTS: Type description based on only left upper cheektooth (DP4). Subsequent fossil material collected in Haiti and deposited at the Florida Museum of Natural History includes complete cranial and dentary material, confirming the validity of this taxon. Hyperplagiodontia stenocoronalis of Rimoli (1976:34) is not distinct from P. araeum. A very large wide-toothed hutia.
Isolobodon portoricensis Allen, 1916 . Ann. New York Acad. Sci., 27:19 . TYPE LOCALITY: Puerto Rico , Jobo Dist., near Utuado . DISTRIBUTION: Hispaniola ( Haiti and Dominican Republic ) and offshore islands. Introduced on Puerto Rico , St. Thomas, St. Croix, and Mona Islands. The only known jutfa on La Gonave island. STATUS: Probably extinct, but possibly surviving on La Tortue island off the north coast of Haiti ( Woods et al., 1985 ). SYNONYMS: levir . COMMENTS: Even though the type locality is Puerto Rico , the species was apparently introduced there by Amerindians and the natural range is restricted to Hispaniola. Reported as extinct by Hall (1981:868) , but this species survived in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico until the last few decades, and may still survive in certain remote areas ( Woods et al., 1985 ). Includes I. levir ( Reynolds et al., 1953 ) .

Myocastor Kerr, 1792 . In Linnaeus, Anim. Kingdom, p. 225 . TYPE SPECIES: Mus coypus Molina, 1782 . SYNONYMS: Mastonotus, Myopotamus, Potamys. COMMENTS: Myocastor is not a capromyid and was referred to the family Myocastoridae by Ameghino (1904) and Woods and Howland (1979:114) . Although Patterson and Pascual (1968b:6) included Myocastor and several fossil forms as the subfamily Myocastorinae of the Echimyidae , it is generally agreed that Myocastor is not an echimyid.
